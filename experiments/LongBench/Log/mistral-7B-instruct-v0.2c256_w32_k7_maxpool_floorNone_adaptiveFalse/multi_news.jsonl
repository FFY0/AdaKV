Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The dinosaur is estimated to be around 1.5 meters long and had a crest on its head. The feathers of Caihong were not just colorful, but also had complex structures, suggesting that coloration may have played a role in its behavior or mating displays. The discovery of Caihong sheds new light on the evolution of feathers and their functions in dinosaurs.

The fossils of Caihong were found in the same area as other feathered dinosaur fossils, suggesting that this region may have been a hotspot for the evolution of feathers.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The incident occurred when the couple, who were both in good physical condition and had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years, decided against summiting due to poor weather conditions. Instead, they opted to find an alternative route down the mountain using a smartphone app.\n\nThe couple, who were described as fit and experienced climbers, used the app to locate a path that they believed would lead them to safety. However, they soon found themselves in a precarious position, unable to progress further due to steep cliffs and treacherous terrain. Despite their efforts to find a way down, they ultimately fell to their deaths.\n\nThe inquest heard that the couple had been using the app to navigate their way down the mountain due to poor visibility caused by fog. The app, which is commonly used by hikers and climbers, relies on GPS technology to provide real-time location data and suggested routes. However, the app does not account for changing weather conditions or the physical condition of the terrain.\n\nThe coroner recorded accidental deaths for both Jane and Gary Wilson. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of being adequately prepared when engaging in outdoor activities, particularly in challenging terrain and weather conditions. It is recommended that hikers and climbers use a combination of maps, compasses, and GPS technology to ensure their safety.\n\nThe tragedy also highlights the limitations of relying solely on technology for navigation, particularly in unpredictable environments. The incident has prompted calls for greater awareness of the risks associated with using smartphone apps for navigation in mountainous and remote areas.\n\nIn response to the incident, the app developer issued a statement expressing their condolences and reminding users to always carry a map and compass as a backup.

The tax, which took effect on January 1, 2018, aims to reduce consumption of sugary drinks and generate revenue for the city. However, opponents argue that it unfairly targets low-income residents and drives consumers to buy their beverages outside the city.\n\nPassage 1 highlights the perspective of a critic who believes the tax is a misguided attempt to improve public health. The author argues that Seattle's example follows in the footsteps of Philadelphia, which repealed its soda tax in 2017 due to public backlash. The author also points out that the tax does not address the root causes of obesity and other health issues.\n\nPassage 2 reports on the impact of the tax on consumers. Seattle residents are expressing frustration over the higher cost of their favorite beverages. Some are crossing city lines to buy their drinks in neighboring towns, while others are stockpiling supplies before the tax takes effect.\n\nPassage 3 provides insight into the rationale behind the tax. Seattle City Councilmember Lisa Herbold explains that the tax is intended to fund various health and education initiatives. She believes that the revenue generated from the tax will have a positive impact on the community.\n\nPassage 4 offers a counterargument to the tax's proponents. The author argues that the tax is regressive and disproportionately affects low-income residents. They also point out that the tax does not address the underlying causes of health issues, such as lack of access to healthy food options and safe recreational spaces.\n\nPassage 5 presents a more nuanced perspective on the issue.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The second study, conducted by researchers at the University of Copenhagen, suggested that acetaminophen use during pregnancy could increase the risk of ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders in children.\n\nThe UCLA study analyzed data from over 145,000 mother-child pairs and found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen for more than 20 days during the first trimester were 29% more likely to have children with ADHD or other behavioral problems compared to those who did not use the drug. The researchers emphasized that their findings do not prove causation, but they believe that acetaminophen may disrupt the development of the fetal brain.\n\nThe Danish study, which followed over 64,000 children, found that those whose mothers had used acetaminophen during pregnancy were 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD or other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Women who used acetaminophen for 20 weeks or longer had a 50% higher chance of their children being prescribed ADHD medication. But the authors did not find a cause-and-effect relationship, and they note that \"exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors\" is not the same as actually having ADHD. Right now, doctors consider acetaminophen the \"safest\" pain reliever for pregnant women, NBC News reports; the study author says pregnant women \"shouldn't worry at this point.\" What could account for the link?

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business.

A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The planet, which is still unnamed, is located in the outer reaches of the solar system and is believed to be larger than Earth. Brown's team made the discovery using data from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and the Gemini Observatory.\n\nIn the second story, Brown is being recognized for his role in the demotion of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) made the decision based on new definitions of what constitutes a planet. Brown, who was a vocal advocate for the reclassification, has since become a controversial figure in the scientific community.\n\nAstronomers are also reporting new evidence of water on the moon, which could potentially be used for future space exploration. The discovery was made using data from NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The water is believed to be located in the moon's polar regions and could be in the form of ice.\n\nIn other news, SpaceX successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The rocket carried a satellite for the Spanish company Hispasat, which will provide communications services to Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The launch was the first from Vandenberg since a Falcon 9 explosion in 2016.\n\nFinally, scientists have discovered a new exoplanet, which is located in the habitable zone of its star. The planet, which is called TOI-700 d, is about the size of Earth and orbits its star every 37 days. The discovery was made using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the Hubble Space Telescope.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed over 9,000 adults for 10 years, found that those who experienced the greatest weight fluctuations had a 50% higher risk of developing heart disease or having a stroke compared to those with stable weight.\n\nThe study builds on previous research linking yo-yo dieting to poor heart health. For instance, a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that weight cycling, as yo-yo dieting is also known, may lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, which can damage the heart and blood vessels. Another study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology found that weight cycling was associated with a higher risk of heart failure.\n\nThe exact mechanisms behind how yo-yo dieting harms the heart are not fully understood, but researchers believe that it may lead to changes in the gut microbiome, which can trigger inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Additionally, rapid weight loss and regain can lead to changes in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and insulin sensitivity, all of which can contribute to heart disease and stroke.\n\nTo prevent yo-yo dieting, experts recommend making sustainable lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats, and engaging in regular physical activity. It's also important to avoid fad diets and focus on long-term weight management rather than quick fixes.\n\nIn related news, a study published in the journal Circulation found that people with coronary artery disease who lost weight and kept it off had better heart health outcomes than those who did not lose weight.

This trend challenges the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening, which typically begin at age 50.\n\nA study published in the journal Cancer found that between 1998 and 2010, the number of colorectal cancer cases among younger adults increased by 2.2% each year. This trend is particularly concerning for younger women, for whom the incidence of colorectal cancer has risen by 3.3% annually.\n\nThe reasons for this increase are not entirely clear, but researchers believe that lifestyle factors, such as obesity and a diet high in red and processed meats, may play a role. Additionally, younger people may be less likely to recognize the symptoms of colorectal cancer or to seek medical care, leading to later diagnosis and poorer outcomes.\n\nColorectal cancer can be prevented or detected early through screening tests, such as colonoscopies. However, many younger adults are not getting screened, despite the fact that colorectal cancer can develop in people of all ages.

{"pred": "\n\nIn three separate discoveries published in Science, researchers have uncovered evidence of significant tool-making and behavioral advances among our early human ancestors. Around 320,000 years ago, hominins in East Africa were using complex stone tools and engaging in social behaviors that suggest a more advanced cognitive capacity.\n\nThe first discovery, made in Kenya, revealed that hominins were producing stone tools with multiple steps, indicating a higher level of planning and skill. These tools, which included flakes with sharp edges and points, were likely used for hunting and butchering meat.\n\nThe second discovery, also in Kenya, showed evidence of social behavior, including the use of fire and the sharing of resources. Hominins were living in groups and working together to obtain food and raw materials for tool-making.\n\nThe third discovery, from Tanzania, provided further evidence of advanced tool-making and social behavior. Hominins were using stones to make other stones into tools, a process known as knapping. They were also using shells as containers and possibly for decorative purposes.\n\nThese findings challenge the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" around 40,000 years ago, and instead suggest that complex behaviors evolved gradually over hundreds of thousands of years. The researchers believe that these advances may have been driven by environmental pressures and the need to adapt to changing conditions.\n\nOverall, these discoveries provide important insights into the early history of our species and challenge long-held assumptions about the timeline of human evolution. They also highlight the importance of ongoing research and discovery in deepening our understanding of our past.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The ECJ determined that the shape of the Kit Kat bar does not qualify for trademark protection as a shape that is necessary to the function of the product. This decision came after an appeal by Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, which had previously lost a similar case in the UK over the shape of its Toblerone bars. The ECJ's ruling could potentially impact other companies that have trademarked the shapes of their products, such as Mars with its Milky Way bars.\n\nThe legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez began in 2012 when Nestlé filed a lawsuit against Mondelez in the UK, arguing that the shape of Kit Kat bars was distinctive enough to be protected by trademark law. However, the UK Intellectual Property Office and the UK High Court both ruled against Nestlé, stating that the shape of the Kit Kat bar was not inherently distinctive and did not function as a source identifier for the product. Mondelez then appealed the decision to the ECJ.\n\nThe ECJ's ruling comes as a blow to Nestlé, which had argued that the shape of the Kit Kat bar was essential to the product's identity and had spent significant resources promoting the \"Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat\" slogan, which emphasized the distinctive shape of the bar. The decision also has implications for other companies that have trademarked the shapes of their products, such as Mars with its Milky Way bars and Ferrero with its Ferrero Rocher balls. These companies may now need to reconsider their trademark strategies and focus on other aspects of their products, such as branding or packaging, to differentiate them from competitors.\n\nThe legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez is not the only trademark dispute between the two companies. In the UK, Nestlé has also challenged Mondelez's trademark on the purple color used to wrap Cadbury's Dairy Milk bars.

This number represents 13% of the global obese population. The study, which is the most comprehensive analysis of obesity trends to date, also shows that obesity is a growing problem in developing countries, with India and China having the second and third largest obese populations, respectively. The report warns that obesity is a major risk factor for various health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The study's authors call for urgent action to address the root causes of obesity, such as unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that obesity costs the global economy $2 trillion annually in healthcare and productivity losses. The report comes as the world marks the International Day for the Fight Against Obesity on May 17th. The day aims to raise awareness of the health and economic consequences of obesity and to promote actions to prevent and address the condition. The report also highlights the importance of addressing the social determinants of obesity, such as poverty, education, and discrimination, in order to reduce health inequalities and promote overall health and well-being.
