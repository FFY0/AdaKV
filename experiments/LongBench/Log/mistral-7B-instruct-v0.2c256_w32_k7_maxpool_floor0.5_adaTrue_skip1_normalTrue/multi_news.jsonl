Two forensic researchers, Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, have conducted a new study on the shroud's bloodstains, which they claim provide evidence that the cloth cannot have been used to wrap a dead body in the manner traditionally believed.\n\nAccording to their findings, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the pattern that would be expected if the cloth had been in contact with a deceased body. Instead, the researchers suggest that the stains may have been caused by the manipulation of the fabric during the shroud's creation or later restoration efforts.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of forensic techniques, including blood flow analysis and microscopic examination, to reach their conclusions. They also compared the shroud's bloodstains to those found on other ancient textiles and modern replicas.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has long been a source of fascination and controversy, with some believing it to be a genuine relic and others dismissing it as a medieval forgery.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

The dinosaur was approximately the size of a turkey and had a crest on its head. Its feathers were preserved in exceptional detail, revealing a rainbow-like sheen due to the presence of melanosomes, the pigment responsible for color in animals. The discovery challenges the long-held belief that dinosaurs were drab and dull in appearance. The scientists believe that the iridescence in Caihong's feathers may have served a social or sexual function, similar to the use of color in some modern animals.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax, which took effect on January 1, 2018, aimed to reduce sugar consumption and generate revenue for the city. However, the tax has faced significant opposition from residents and retailers.\n\nAccording to reports, Seattle's tax on sweetened beverages is the highest in the nation, with a rate of 1.75 cents per ounce. The tax applies to both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks, including sodas, juices, and sports drinks. The revenue generated from the tax is intended to fund various health and education programs in the city.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the tax is regressive and disproportionately affects low-income families. They claim that the tax will drive up the cost of essential items, such as milk and baby formula, which contain natural sugars. Furthermore, opponents argue that the tax will not achieve its intended health goals, as many people will simply drive to neighboring cities to purchase their beverages.\n\nCostco, a major retailer in the Seattle area, has announced that it will not pass on the tax to its customers and will absorb the cost instead. However, other retailers have threatened to leave the city or pass on the cost to consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, in other cities, similar soda taxes have faced similar challenges. In Berkeley, California, a soda tax was implemented in 2014, but a recent study found that it had little impact on reducing soda consumption.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

In multiple interviews, Clinton stated that she had no plans to run for president in 2016. She emphasized that she was focused on her current role and was enjoying her time in New Zealand, which was her second-to-last stop on the tour.\n\nThe speculation about Clinton's future political ambitions arose during a meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who accidentally referred to Clinton as \"President Clinton\" during a speech. The gaffe caused a stir, with some media outlets interpreting it as an indication of Clinton's intentions.\n\nClinton's denial of any presidential aspirations came as the U.S. midterm elections resulted in a Republican takeover of the Senate and a strengthened Republican presence in the House of Representatives. The election results have raised questions about the direction of U.S. foreign policy under a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nDespite Clinton's statement, her popularity and strong leadership skills have kept her as a potential contender for the Democratic nomination in 2016. However, Clinton has not given any indication that she will change her mind and run for president.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific tour, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines, has been focused on strengthening diplomatic ties and economic partnerships in the region. Clinton's visit to New Zealand was an opportunity to discuss bilateral issues, including trade and security, with Prime Minister Key. The two leaders also discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a multinational free trade agreement that the U.S. and New Zealand are negotiating.\n\nIn conclusion, during her visit to New Zealand, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put to rest any speculation about her potential presidential run in 2016.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission aims to provide new insights into the Sun's outer layers and solar wind, which can impact Earth's space environment and technology in orbit. The probe is expected to launch in summer 2018 and will approach the Sun's surface, getting closer than any spacecraft before. The mission's data will help scientists understand the Sun's dynamic behavior and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nIn addition to the renaming announcement, NASA also revealed that the Parker Solar Probe has passed a critical milestone in its development. The spacecraft's heat shield, which will protect it from the extreme heat of the Sun, has been successfully tested. The heat shield is made of a carbon composite material and will maintain a temperature of around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) despite the Sun's surface temperature of over 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is not the only solar mission making headlines.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study, which followed over 9,000 men and women for 10 years, found that those who experienced the greatest weight fluctuations had a 50% higher risk of developing coronary artery disease compared to those with stable weights.\n\nThe study builds on previous research linking yo-yo dieting to poor heart health. Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of cholesterol and other substances. This can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, and strokes.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, explained that the repeated weight loss and regain can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, which can damage the lining of the arteries and contribute to the development of coronary artery disease.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and avoiding fad diets, to maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of heart disease.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

Instead, Apple is encouraging users to adopt wireless headphones or use the Lightning port for wired headphones. The decision has sparked controversy and criticism from tech pundits and consumers alike.\n\nMany individuals who have attended every Apple keynote since 1998 expressed their disappointment and frustration over the decision. They argued that Apple was removing a long-standing feature without providing a compelling reason or alternative. Some even went as far as to call the move \"ridiculous,\" \"stupid,\" and \"greedy.\"\n\nThe lack of a headphone jack is not the only change Apple made to the new iPhones. The company also introduced new water-resistant designs, improved cameras, and faster processors. However, these advancements have been overshadowed by the headphone jack controversy.\n\nApple's decision to remove the headphone jack is not without precedent. Other companies, such as Motorola and LeEco, have already made the switch to USB-C ports for their smartphones. However, Apple's influence and market power make this change more significant.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack is a bold move that is sure to provoke strong reactions from Apple fans and critics alike. While some may view it as a courageous step towards a wireless future, others see it as a short-sighted and arrogant decision that disregards the needs and preferences of its customers.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The surgery, led by consultant plastic surgeon Mr. David Dunaway, involved grafting the cartilage to create the shape of ears, which were then covered with a skin flap taken from Kieran's back. The procedure was primarily cosmetic, as Kieran already wears hearing aids.\n\nKieran's father, David Sorkin, described the family's excitement and relief, stating that the boy had been teased and bullied due to his appearance.

The surgery was a success, and Kieran will only require a follow-up procedure to make the ears stand out more.\n\nThe procedure marks a significant milestone in the field of plastic surgery and is expected to benefit other children born with similar conditions.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The ECJ determined that the shape of the Kit Kat bar does not qualify for trademark protection under EU law. Nestlé had argued that the shape of the bar, which includes the distinctive four-finger design, had become distinctive enough to be considered a trademark. However, the ECJ disagreed, stating that the shape of the bar does not allow consumers to easily distinguish the product from others on the market. This decision comes after a similar case involving Lindt & Sprüngli's Leo chocolate bars, which also failed to secure trademark protection for their shape.\n\nThe legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, over the shape of Kit Kat bars and Cadbury's use of the purple color for its Dairy Milk bars in the UK is ongoing. Nestlé had argued that Cadbury's use of the purple color infringed on its trademark rights, but the UK Intellectual Property Office and the UK High Court have both ruled against Nestlé. The case is currently being appealed to the UK Court of Appeal.\n\nThe ECJ's decision on the Kit Kat bars is significant as it sets a precedent for future cases involving the trademark protection of product shapes in the EU.

According to a study published in the journal Current Biology, new research suggests that dinosaurs likely did not have the large, powerful vocal cords necessary for the iconic roars often depicted in movies and media. Instead, they may have produced sounds similar to those of modern birds, such as chirps, clicks, or calls.\n\nAdditionally, the T. rex and other dinosaurs may have been covered in feathers, not just for insulation but also for display purposes during mating rituals. This theory is based on the discovery of well-preserved fossils with feather impressions, which have been found in various dinosaur species.\n\nMeanwhile, in the realm of pop culture, the fearsome image of the T. rex has been reimagined in a more lighthearted way. A new exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., features a T. rex skeleton wearing a feathered costume, complete with a tiny dinosaur hat. The exhibit aims to showcase the latest scientific findings about dinosaurs while also engaging visitors with a touch of humor.\n\nFinally, a recent study published in the journal Current Biology sheds light on the vocalizations of modern birds and their potential connection to dinosaurs. Researchers found that some bird species, such as the superb lyrebird, are capable of producing a wide range of sounds, including imitations of other animals and even human-made noises. This ability may be a remnant of the vocal capabilities of their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nIn summary, recent scientific discoveries have challenged the long-held beliefs about dinosaurs' appearance and vocalizations.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

{"pred": "\n\nEgyptians returned to the polls for the final round of parliamentary elections on January 22, 2012, while former President Hosni Mubarak's trial resumed with the chief prosecutor accusing him of corruption and abuse of power. In the elections, Islamist parties were expected to make significant gains, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafist Al-Nour Party leading in the race. The parliamentary elections, which began in November 2011, were the first free and fair elections in Egypt's history since the ousting of Mubarak in February 2011.\n\nAt the trial, Mustafa Suleiman, the chief prosecutor, accused Mubarak of embezzlement, abuse of power, and conspiring to kill protesters during the 2011 uprising. Mubarak, who is currently in detention, was also charged with ordering the use of excessive force against protesters, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people. The trial, which began in August 2011, has been delayed several times due to legal challenges and the absence of key witnesses.\n\nThe parliamentary elections, which are being closely watched by the international community, are seen as a crucial step towards democratic transition in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood, which was banned under Mubarak's rule, is expected to win a significant number of seats in the parliament. The Salafist Al-Nour Party, which is known for its conservative Islamic views, is also expected to make significant gains. The elections are being held in a tense political environment, with ongoing protests and clashes between supporters of different political groups.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak and his co-defendants is seen as a test of Egypt's commitment to holding those responsible for human rights abuses accountable.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party.
