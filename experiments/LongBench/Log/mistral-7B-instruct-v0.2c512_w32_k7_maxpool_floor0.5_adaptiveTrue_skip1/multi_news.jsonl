The researchers found that cigarette smoke enhances the virulence of MRSA by activating the quorum sensing system, which allows the bacteria to communicate and coordinate their behavior, making them more resistant to antibiotics.\n\nThe second study, also published in the journal Infection and Immunity, showed that cigarette smoke triggers MRSA-infected cells to produce more toxins and inflammatory molecules, making the infection more severe.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The comparison to Orwell's novel is not far-fetched, as the policy states that the TV can be activated by certain keywords, and users are advised that their conversations may be recorded and used for advertising purposes.

Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent with the image of a person who was crucified and wrapped in the cloth.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the position of the body depicted in the image.

The house, which is rectangular in shape, is remarkably well-preserved and is located near the edge of the henge monument. The house is believed to have been used for feasting and social gatherings, as evidenced by the large number of flint tools and animal bones found on the site.

The child's remains will be subjected to further analysis to determine more information about their age, gender, and diet.\n\nBoth excavations are part of a larger project to better understand the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.

The tax, which took effect on January 1, 2018, was intended to reduce sugar consumption, fund community programs, and generate revenue for the city. However, the tax has faced significant opposition and controversy.\n\nAccording to critics, the tax is regressive and disproportionately affects low-income families. They argue that the tax does not address the root causes of health issues and instead places an undue burden on those least able to afford it. Seattle's soda tax is not the first of its kind, with Cook County, Illinois, repealing a similar tax in 2017 due to public backlash.\n\nCosts of the Seattle tax have been significant. Seattle residents have reported price increases on beverages, with some retailers passing on the tax to consumers. Costco, a major retailer in the area, has gone as far as to install signs directing customers to their stores outside the city limits, where the tax does not apply. The tax has also led to concerns about lost revenue for local businesses and potential job losses.\n\nDespite these challenges, supporters of the tax argue that it is an important step towards promoting public health and reducing health care costs in the long run. They point to studies showing that sugary drink consumption is linked to obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. However, critics argue that the tax does not address the underlying causes of these health issues and instead places an unfair burden on consumers.\n\nThe debate over Seattle's soda tax is ongoing, with both sides making passionate arguments.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

{"pred": "\n\nTwo recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy. According to the first report, researchers in Denmark found that pregnant women who frequently used acetaminophen to relieve pain and reduce fever were more likely to have children with ADHD or other behavioral disorders. The study, which was published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, but the researchers suggested that acetaminophen may disrupt fetal brain development.\n\nThe second study, published in the journal Pediatrics, also linked prenatal acetaminophen exposure to behavioral issues in children. This study, which was conducted in the United States, found that children whose mothers took acetaminophen during pregnancy were more likely to exhibit hyperactivity and inattention symptoms.\n\nBoth studies have prompted experts to advise pregnant women to avoid taking acetaminophen unless absolutely necessary. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant women use the lowest effective dose of acetaminophen for the shortest possible time. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also reviewing the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy and plans to release new guidelines soon.\n\nDespite the concerns, some experts caution against panicking. Dr. Beate Ritz, the lead author of the Danish study, said that pregnant women should not stop taking acetaminophen if they have a fever or are in pain. Instead, they should try to manage their symptoms with other methods, such as rest, hydration, and over-the-counter remedies like ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin).\n\nThe studies have also highlighted the importance of being cautious about the safety of medications during pregnancy. Dr. Jeffrey Gold, the editor of Pediatrics, said that pregnant women should always consult their healthcare provider before taking any medication, and that they should be aware that some drugs may have risks that are not yet fully understood.\n\nIn summary, two studies have suggested that acetaminophen use during pregnancy may be linked to behavioral issues in children. While the studies did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, experts advise pregnant women to use the lowest effective dose of acetaminophen for the shortest possible", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

The risk increased the later in pregnancy the drug was taken and the longer it was taken. Women who used acetaminophen for 20 weeks or longer had a 50% higher chance of their children being prescribed ADHD medication. But the authors did not find a cause-and-effect relationship, and they note that \"exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors\" is not the same as actually having ADHD.

The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds. Of course, employees will have to plan their leave with managers and coworkers in advance to make sure their absence isn't disruptive—behaving, you know, like adults.

The existence of Planet Nine was first suggested by the unusual orbits of certain distant objects in the solar system, which appeared to be influenced by the gravitational pull of an unseen planet. The researchers have not yet directly observed Planet Nine, but they believe that it exists based on the mathematical modeling of the orbits of these distant objects.\n\nMike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech who was involved in the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, has been referred to as the \"Pluto killer\" due to his role in the demotion of Pluto from planet status in 2006.

The study, which followed over 9,000 participants for an average of five years, found that those who experienced the greatest weight fluctuations had a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease and dying from related causes compared to those with more stable weight.\n\nCoronary artery disease is a condition in which the major blood vessels supplying the heart become damaged or diseased. This can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, and strokes. The disease is often caused by a buildup of cholesterol and other deposits, called plaque, in the arteries.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, of NYU Langone Health in New York City, explained that the findings are particularly concerning for people with coronary artery disease because their hearts are already vulnerable. He added that even small weight fluctuations can be harmful, and that losing weight and then regaining it can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress in the arteries.\n\nPrevious research has linked yo-yo dieting to an increased risk of heart disease, but this study is the first to specifically examine the relationship between weight fluctuations and coronary artery disease. The researchers controlled for other risk factors, such as age, smoking, and cholesterol levels, to ensure that the observed relationship was due to weight fluctuations and not other factors.\n\nThe study also found that individuals who gained weight back after losing it were more likely to develop new risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, than those who maintained a stable weight.\n\nThe study's authors emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding yo-yo dieting. They suggested that people aim for gradual weight loss, rather than rapid weight loss followed by weight gain. They also recommended making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, to help maintain a healthy weight over the long term.\n\nIn conclusion, the study adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that yo-yo dieting can be harmful to heart health, particularly for individuals with coronary artery disease.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

He crafted a bold and unprecedented warning, which became known as the \"most dire weather forecast ever.\" The forecast, which predicted widespread devastation and urged people to evacuate, was later displayed in the Smithsonian Museum.\n\nRicks' forecast came a day before the storm hit, and its accuracy was evident in the aftermath.

They found that between 1998 and 2011, approximately 37,000 cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in patients under 50. This number represents about 13% of all colorectal cancer cases during that period.\n\nThe study also revealed that younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of colorectal cancer, and were less likely to receive recommended treatments. This may be due to the fact that symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as blood in the stool or unexplained weight loss, are often overlooked or attributed to other conditions in younger individuals.\n\nThe study's findings highlight the need for increased awareness and earlier screening for colorectal cancer in younger adults. The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals with an average risk of colorectal cancer begin regular screening at age 45. Those with a higher risk, such as a family history of the disease, should begin screening at an even younger age.\n\nDespite the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger adults, there is still a lack of understanding and awareness about the disease in this population.

This discovery challenges the previously accepted timeline for the arrival of humans in Australia. The site, known as Warratyi Rock Shelter, was discovered by chance when a team of researchers was surveying the area for potential archaeological sites. The findings include stone tools, animal bones, and charcoal, which have been radiocarbon dated to around 49,000 years old. The discovery of red ochre pigment at the site also suggests that early humans in Australia were using symbolic art as early as 49,000 years ago. The discovery of this early human presence in Australia is significant because it pushes back the timeline for the arrival of humans in the continent by around 10,000 years. The discovery also challenges the theory that humans only arrived in Australia after the last ice age, as the site is located in a region that was not habitable during that time. The findings will be published in the journal Nature. The discovery of Warratyi Rock Shelter is a major breakthrough in understanding the early history of human presence in Australia.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

However, many critics argue that this is not a courageous move, but rather a hubris, arrogant, and even stupid one.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack means that users will have to adapt to using either wireless headphones or the Lightning port for wired headphones. Apple is including a pair of Lightning EarPods in the box, but users will have to purchase an adapter to use their old wired headphones. Some see this as a money-grabbing tactic, as Apple is also selling wireless AirPods for $159.\n\nThe lack of a headphone jack has also raised concerns about the accessibility of the new iPhones for people with disabilities, as well as the potential for increased costs for those who rely on wired headphones for work or other purposes. Additionally, some have pointed out that the new iPhones are not waterproof when using the Lightning port for audio, unlike the older models which were waterproof with the headphone jack.\n\nThe reaction to Apple's decision has been overwhelmingly negative, with many taking to social media to express their frustration and disappointment.

This merger underscores the growing importance of the derivatives market, which has surpassed the stock market in size. The NYSE, which has been a symbol of traditional stock trading for over two centuries, is now primarily known for its businesses in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. ICE, founded in 2000, is based in Atlanta and competes fiercely with the Chicago-based CME Group in the derivatives market. The deal, which could be announced as soon as Thursday, would create a company with 14 stock and futures exchanges and five clearing operations, making it the largest player in the industry.\n\nThe second story reported that the NYSE's merger with ICE would mark the end of floor trading at the iconic exchange. The merger would also signify the triumph of electronic trading over traditional open outcry trading methods.

It has been successfully used in past search and rescue operations, including the search for Air France Flight 447 in 2009.\n\nIn the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Bayesian inference is being used to analyze data from satellite communications, radar tracking, and other sources to estimate the most likely location of the plane. Bayesian statisticians are also using historical data on similar aircraft and flight patterns to inform their analysis.\n\nThe use of Bayesian inference in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is not without challenges. One of the main challenges is the large amount of data that needs to be analyzed and the need to continually update beliefs as new information becomes available. Another challenge is the uncertainty surrounding the cause of the plane's disappearance, which could affect the accuracy of the statistical models.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bayesian inference is seen as a valuable tool in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. It allows search teams to make informed decisions based on the available data and to prioritize their efforts based on the most likely location of the plane.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

Police say Caballero later confronted Austin outside his apartment and shot him dead. The body was found in the parking lot of Austin's apartment complex. A Vermont State Police spokesman says Caballero, who knew Austin before the shooting, fled the town and probably the state after the shooting, WCAX reports. The police spokesman says Caballero is believed to have boarded a Greyhound bus bound for New York City on Sunday morning, which made numerous stops in other states along the way. Later Sunday, Cary, 22, was arrested on apparently unrelated charges of selling heroin and crack cocaine. With around 7,500 residents, Montpelier has the smallest population of any state capital, the AP notes.

This means that there will be a total lunar eclipse, where the moon turns a reddish color due to the Earth's atmosphere, during a full moon that is closer to Earth than usual, making it appear larger. This phenomenon has not occurred since 1866.\n\nThe event will be visible from most of the Western Hemisphere, Central America, and parts of Asia and the Pacific. The eclipse will begin at 5:51 am EST and end at 8:48 am EST. The best time to view the eclipse will be during moonrise, which will vary depending on the location.\n\nAstronomy enthusiasts can join live broadcasts of the event from various organizations, including The Virtual Telescope Project, which will offer a live feed starting at 4:30 am EST. The Virtual Telescope Project will also have a team of astronomers available to answer questions during the broadcast.\n\nThe Super Blue Blood Moon is a rare event, and it is also significant because it is the second Supermoon of the year, and the third of a trilogy that began with a Supermoon on December 3, 2017. The next total lunar eclipse will not occur until May 26, 2021.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project has a team of astronomers and collaborators who will be observing and documenting the event from various locations around the world. The team includes Gianluca Masi, Luca Limatola, and Alessandro Miani, among others.\n\nThe Super Blue Blood Moon is a unique astronomical event that is sure to captivate the imagination of people around the world. It is a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the universe and the importance of taking the time to appreciate the natural world around us.\n\nIf you are unable to view the event in person, there are several ways to watch it online, including through the Virtual Telescope Project and other organizations. So mark your calendars and get ready to witness this rare and spectacular astronomical event.", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years. For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.
