MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections and is often resistant to antibiotics. The studies found that cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor alter the cell walls of MRSA, allowing it to repel common forms of immune responses.\n\nIn the first study, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time being killed by macrophages, immune cells that devour infectious agents. The smoke-exposed MRSA was also more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, two lines of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Additionally, MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, making it more successful in its invasion. The more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became.\n\nThe second study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, enhancing its survival against reactive oxygen species. MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, meaning a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendants in 12 hours.\n\nWhen smoke-exposed MRSA was put into mice, there was a significant difference in mortality compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed.

Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent with each other and cannot be explained by a crucified person.\n\nThe researchers found that the hand stains on the shroud do not match the angle of gravity that would be present if the person was crucified. The spear wound stain also did not match the pattern seen in their experiments.

The charity was founded by J.K. Rowling after she was moved by the plight of children living in institutions.\n\nThe passage described the horrific conditions in these institutions, where children as young as six were caged most of the day and night. The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but are placed in institutions due to poverty or lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs.\n\nInstitutionalized children suffer from measurable and sometimes irreparable harm, including lack of education and physical or mental health issues, malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking. The effects on infants are particularly chronic, with many failing to thrive or dying.\n\nThe solution to this problem is not to make institutions more comfortable, but to eliminate them altogether. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 through investment in inclusive education and health, support for vulnerable families, and fostering, adoption, or other family-based care alternatives for children who cannot be with their parents.\n\nInternational donors play a vital role in this effort, as their funding choices and principles greatly influence the support available to children and families. The economic benefits of supporting a child in a family rather than an institution are significant, as these children are far less likely to become dependent in adulthood.\n\nLumos has seen success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where there have been significant reductions in the number of children in institutions.

Davis' revelation humanizes her stance on the issue and adds a personal dimension to the debate.\n\nThe Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which includes Davis' account of her filibuster against Texas' tough new abortion restrictions in 2013. During her filibuster, Davis read testimonies of women who had undergone abortions due to medical conditions, including one woman whose story mirrored Davis' own. The filibuster temporarily delayed the passage of the bill, which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandates clinic upgrades to hospital-level standards. A federal judge later blocked a portion of the law, leaving seven abortion facilities in operation statewide.\n\nAnti-abortion groups have expressed sympathy for Davis' difficult choices but maintain their stance on the value of life. Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, praised Davis' \"unwavering courage\" and her commitment to women's reproductive rights. Davis' memoir is expected to provide further insight into her life story, which includes her hardscrabble upbringing and her journey from a single mother to a state sen", "answers": ["Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' new memoir is dedicated in part to daughters Amber, Dru, and Tate, and those familiar with Davis' life story might be puzzled by the last name on that list. That's because Davis is revealing for the first time that Tate is the unborn child that she and her husband aborted in the second trimester, after doctors discovered a severe brain abnormality. The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized. After the abortion, \"an indescribable blackness followed,\" writes Davis in Forgetting to Be Afraid, \"and when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person.\" Davis also writes of a previously disclosed procedure to terminate an earlier ectopic pregnancy in which the embryo was implanted outside the uterus. She says she opted not to talk about either case during her famous filibuster because she feared it would \"overshadow the events of the day.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2373}

The house, which was not a permanent residence, was likely used for feasts and gatherings. The site, which includes a massive enclosure of 15 hectares, is believed to have been built for status and wealth display.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child was discovered. The child, wearing an amber necklace, was found in a foetal position. Scientific analysis will be conducted to determine the gender, diet, and date of burial, which may shed light on where the child lived.\n\nBoth sites are part of the Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum.

The trail, which stretches from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, has a maximum capacity of 50 hikers per day during the high season. This increase in hikers has led to concerns about overcrowding, environmental damage, and financial strain on essential services.\n\nThe fragile desert environments in the first 700 miles of the trail are particularly susceptible to damage from hikers. U.S. Forest Service volunteer Jules Fijolek notes that deserts are \"fragile ecosystems\" and that damage can last for a long time. The PCTA has implemented a permit system to mitigate the impact of hikers and spread them out along the trail. However, the honor system is currently the only means of enforcing this system, and some hikers are still exceeding the daily limit.\n\nThe increase in hikers has also put a strain on essential services, with over 20 rescues already taking place in the first 50 miles of the trail in 2016.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The images, which feature her father and Kurt Cobain, were discovered tucked away in her father's biographies of Cobain and Nirvana. The concert took place in her father's basement, with Nirvana's lineup consisting of Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Aaron Burckhard. Poukkula joined the band on guitar for at least two Led Zeppelin covers during the performance. The setlist included nascent versions of \"Aero Zeppelin,\" \"Mexican Seafood,\" \"Pen Cap Chew,\" \"Hairspray Queen,\" \"Spank Thru,\" and \"If You Must.\" Previously, these photographs and the related Nirvana memorabilia were unknown to Poukkula, but their discovery has shed new light on the band's early days.\n\nSecondly, the Internet Archive is working on archiving web pages as they are created and preserving the pages they reference.

The researchers cautioned that this doesn't mean that taking acetaminophen once or twice during pregnancy will harm the child, but advised pregnant women to avoid chronic or long-term use. The second study, also published in JAMA Pediatrics, found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may be associated with ADHD-like behaviors in children. However, the studies did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, and more research is needed to understand the risks and benefits of acetaminophen use during pregnancy.\n\nAcetaminophen is commonly recommended by doctors for treating mild pain in pregnant women. However, the Danish study analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers and found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD-like behaviors and medication use.

The House of Representatives passed a bill to fund federal agencies through December 15, but the Senate is unlikely to approve it due to Democratic opposition to conditions that would delay the Affordable Care Act and repeal the medical device tax. House Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from conservative Republicans to continue the fight against the health care law, but a government shutdown could have serious economic consequences, particularly for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to a large concentration of federal workers and contractors. According to estimates, a shutdown could cost the region $200 million a day and result in the furlough of over 700,000 workers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hard line against the Republicans, urging them to back down and pass a clean funding bill. If a shutdown occurs, essential services such as mail delivery, air traffic control, and military operations would continue, but non-essential services would be suspended, and hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed. The economic impact of a shutdown could be felt beyond the Washington D.C. area, as federal spending accounts for a significant portion of the national economy. The political ramifications of a shutdown are also uncertain, with both parties trying to blame the other for the impasse.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The malware, which is new to eCrime, is highly sophisticated and can net big rewards for cyber crooks with little risk. The report also mentioned that Eastern Europe has been the focal point for POS malware development and use.\n\nBoth attacks are currently being investigated by a growing group of state attorneys general, and it is believed that they may be related.

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased, often due to cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nPrevious studies have associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health.

The forecast, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, was considered by many to be the most dire and effective weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service.\n\nAt the time, evacuations were underway and people were starting to arrive at the Superdome. Ricks knew he had one last chance to get the message out. He sat down at his desk and using computers, history, and his fellow forecasters, he wrote the extraordinary bulletin titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE.\" The document predicted devastating damage, including roof and wall failure for most homes, total defoliation of trees, and water shortages leading to incredible human suffering.\n\nRicks' forecast was right, and the images of devastation that followed made it clear. The lifelong resident of New Orleans, who grew up in the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward section of the city, was back at work alongside co-workers who had no homes and were wearing the clothes they wore that day. Ricks, who had experienced Hurricanes Betsy and Camille in the past, was devastated by the response, but he had done everything in his power to warn people of the monster storm coming their way.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

The results showed that 37,847 (about 15%) of the 258,000 total colorectal cancer patients were younger than 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease, including regional or distant malignancies.\n\nTreatment patterns also differed between younger and older patients. Younger patients underwent more aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, which led to slightly better outcomes. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had a five-year survival rate of 61.1% compared to 60.3% for older patients.\n\nThe study suggests that the medical community should be more vigilant in identifying colorectal cancer in younger individuals.

The second article discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960. Dyson suggested that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The findings challenge the previous belief that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago, marking a \"human revolution.\" Instead, the evidence suggests that these advanced behaviors were present much earlier, around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers examined newly discovered tools and artifacts from the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya. They found that the climate shifts in East Africa during this time may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among early humans. The oldest tools discovered are around 320,000 years old and represent a significant shift from earlier, larger stone tools. These new tools were smaller and more specialized, indicating greater planning and advanced thinking.\n\nThe researchers also found evidence of long-distance trade, as obsidian tools were transported from distant sources to the Olorgesailie Basin. Additionally, they discovered the earliest known use of pigments, which may have been used for symbolic purposes.\n\nThese findings challenge the Eurocentric view that modern behaviors and innovations only emerged as humans migrated out of Africa. Instead, the evidence suggests that African populations were technologically and culturally advanced long before the emergence of modern humans.\n\nThe researchers also noted that the transition from Early Stone Age to Middle Stone Age technology in Africa is complex and not yet fully understood. However, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide important insights into the early development of human behavior and technology.\n\nOverall, these studies offer a new perspective on the early history of human development and challenge previous assumptions about when and where modern behaviors emerged.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

In the case of Guantánamo, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained there, including legal residents of the U.S. The detainees, most of whom were taken into custody without evidence, have been seeking to challenge their detention through habeas corpus petitions since 2002. However, the Bush administration has prevented them from getting a fair hearing in the courts. The Supreme Court is set to hear their cases again in the coming term.\n\nMeanwhile, in a groundbreaking decision, a New York judge granted a pair of research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, the right to have their day in court through a writ of habeas corpus. This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by this legal procedure. The Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, hopes that this ruling could lead to the release of the chimpanzees and potentially other research animals. However, some legal experts caution against reading too much into the ruling, as the judge may simply want more information before making a decision on the legal personhood claim. The case began in December 2013, when the group petitioned three lower court judges with a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the chimpanzees were too cognitively and emotionally complex to be held in captivity. The judges quickly struck down each case, but the Nonhuman Rights Project has been appealing ever since.

{"pred": "\n\nRecent studies suggest that Mars once had a significant amount of water on its surface, making it a potentially habitable planet. According to a team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, an ancient ocean covering nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars existed around 4.5 billion years ago. This ocean was at least a mile deep and held over 20 million cubic kilometers of water, making it a promising environment for the emergence of life.\n\nThe evidence for this ancient ocean comes from the analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. Mars has a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in its water compared to Earth. By calculating the rate of deuterium loss from Mars' atmosphere, scientists can estimate the amount of water that once existed on the planet. The results indicate that there was enough water to cover the entire planet to a depth of 137 meters.\n\nHowever, this estimate may be a conservative one, as other studies suggest that the early Martian atmosphere had a higher concentration of water vapor than current measurements indicate. This would mean that the ancient ocean covered a larger area of the planet's surface.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean challenges previous assumptions about Mars as a dry and arid planet. It also adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with the potential to support life.\n\nThe search for life on Mars continues, with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover set to explore the planet's surface in 2018. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, potentially providing further evidence of Mars' past habitability.\n\nIn related news, a team of scientists led by Michael Mumma from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has found strong isotopic anomalies in the Martian atmosphere, indicating significant water loss. The maps of atmospheric water and its deuterated form reveal that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium, suggesting that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nOverall, these studies provide compelling evidence that Mars was once a much wetter and potentially habitable planet than previously believed.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Meanwhile, the female lead was rumored to be played by a multitude of young actresses under the age of 35.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the casting, Smith and Robbie ultimately secured the roles, with Smith's charm and charisma making him the perfect fit for the con man character. Smith's ability to persuade anyone of anything has been a staple of his acting career since his Fresh Prince days, and this film allows him to showcase that talent once again.\n\n\"Focus\" is a departure for Smith, who has spent much of his career in action and sci-fi roles, often requiring him to adopt a more serious and macho demeanor.

The study, which analyzed the vocalizations of various archosaur species, including birds and crocodiles, found that closed-mouth vocalizations have evolved independently at least 16 times within the archosaur group.

{"pred": "\n\nA new report published in the medical journal Lancet reveals that obesity is a growing problem worldwide, with nearly 30% of the global population, or 2.1 billion people, now considered overweight or obese. The USA leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's obese population, but other countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands, also have high obesity rates. The causes of obesity are complex and include the availability of cheap, high-calorie junk food and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity is a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and kills about 3.4 million adults annually. The number of overweight and obese people has increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children over the past 33 years. The problem is not limited to rich countries; it is affecting people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with not one country succeeding in cutting its obesity rate. The biggest increases in obesity among women were seen in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while among men, it was in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The problem is most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women are overweight or obese. The report notes that obesity is not just a cosmetic issue, but a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Obesity is appearing at increasingly young ages, with rates rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. The rate of increase in adult obesity has slowed in rich countries, but the problem is still a major concern. More than half of the world's obese population lives in just 10 countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia.
