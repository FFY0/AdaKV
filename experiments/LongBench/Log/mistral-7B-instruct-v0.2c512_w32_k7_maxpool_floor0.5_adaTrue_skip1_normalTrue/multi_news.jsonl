Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is a significant milestone in solar exploration and will provide valuable data for understanding the sun and its impact on the solar system.\n\nIn related news, NASA has also announced that it will rename the upcoming mission from the Solar Probe Plus to the Parker Solar Probe, in honor of Eugene Parker. The renaming is a fitting tribute to the scientist who first proposed the existence of solar wind and whose theories have shaped the field of solar physics. Parker, now 91, attended the announcement and expressed his excitement about the mission.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is expected to provide crucial data on solar wind and solar activity, which can impact Earth's space environment and climate.

Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech who was involved in the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, is leading the research team. The team's findings are based on the orbits of several distant Kuiper Belt objects, which appear to be influenced by the gravitational pull of an unseen planet. The researchers believe that Planet Nine is a super-Earth or a Neptune-like planet, with a mass between five and ten times that of Earth and an orbit that takes it far beyond Neptune. Brown and his team have not yet directly observed Planet Nine, but they are confident that it exists and are continuing their search for it.\n\nBrown gained notoriety in 2006 when he was instrumental in the demotion of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet. He has since become known as the \"Pluto killer,\" a title he embraces with a sense of humor. In a recent interview, Brown discussed his role in the discovery of Planet Nine and his feelings about Pluto's demotion. He expressed his excitement about the new discovery and his belief that it will help scientists better understand the outer reaches of our solar system.\n\nCaltech researchers are not the only ones searching for a ninth planet. Other teams, including those at the Carnegie Institution for Science and the University of California, Los Angeles, are also looking for evidence of a large, unseen planet in the outer solar system.

{"pred": "\n\nIn the realm of space exploration and advanced civilizations, several intriguing concepts have emerged in recent news. First, the idea of expanding a civilization beyond its home planet and harvesting resources from other planets has been revisited through the lens of Nikolai Kardashev's 1962 model of civilizational advancement. This model proposes three types of civilizations based on their energy consumption: Type I, which uses all the energy available on its planet; Type II, which harnesses the energy of its star; and Type III, which utilizes the energy of an entire galaxy.\n\nA new paper posted on arXiv.org by Dan Hooper revives this model and adds an apocalyptic twist. According to Hooper, as civilizations advance and expand, they will eventually need to harvest energy from distant stars to prevent being left behind in the ever-expanding universe. This concept is not only a means of survival but also a potential way to detect advanced alien civilizations.\n\nMeanwhile, the search for advanced alien civilizations continues, with scientists and science fiction authors pondering the possibilities of mega-structures like Dyson spheres. These structures, which would surround a star and capture its energy, have been proposed as a potential sign of an advanced civilization. Science fiction author Olaf Stapledon first introduced this concept in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Internet Archive's WARCZone collection has been highlighted as a valuable resource for researchers studying the history of the internet and the World Wide Web. This collection contains data that may not be available through other means and provides a unique perspective on the development of the digital world.\n\nIn summary, the news covers the ongoing search for advanced alien civilizations, the potential for mega-structures like Dyson spheres as signs of intelligent life, and the importance of preserving digital history through resources like the Internet Archive's WARCZone collection.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh s---, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn’t exist. That was really, really exciting.\" Click for the full piece, in which Stewart talks about how that 2000 campaign provided his \"aha moment\" of how to present the show—by \"deconstructing the process.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 7229}

Instead, the research suggests that technologically advanced behaviors, such as tool-making and innovation, emerged much earlier than previously believed, around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings come from excavations in Kenya, where researchers discovered stone tools and artifacts dating back to the Middle Stone Age. These tools, which include small, sharp flints, were previously thought to be the work of Homo sapiens, but new evidence suggests that they were made by Homo heidelbergensis, an ancestor of modern humans.\n\nThe researchers argue that these early humans were capable of complex behaviors, including social organization and communication, which allowed them to adapt to changing environments and survive. They also suggest that climate change may have played a role in driving technological innovation and cultural development.\n\nThe discovery of these early advanced behaviors challenges the Eurocentric view of human history, which has long held that modern human behavior emerged in Europe around 40,000 years ago. Instead, the research suggests that human evolution was a more gradual process, with complex behaviors emerging in Africa much earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe studies also highlight the importance of ongoing research and reevaluation of the archaeological record. As one researcher noted, \"Every time we go back to the field and dig, we learn something new.\"\n\nOverall, the new findings provide important insights into the early history of human behavior and challenge long-held assumptions about the timing and nature of the \"human revolution.\" They also underscore the importance of ongoing research and the need to reevaluate our understanding of human evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The activists, who included religious leaders and community organizers, argue that the shut-offs constitute a human rights violation and disproportionately affect low-income residents.\n\nMeanwhile, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department has intensified its efforts to collect delinquent payments, targeting both residential and commercial accounts. The department has shut off water to over 13,000 households since March, and plans to cut off another 3,000 in the coming weeks. Critics argue that the department's collection tactics are unfair, as it targets poor residents while ignoring large commercial debts. The department owes approximately $6 billion, and the shut-offs are seen as a necessary measure to help pay down the debt and keep water rates affordable for paying customers.\n\nDetroit Congressman John Conyers has weighed in on the issue, sending letters to President Obama and the United Nations urging them to intervene in the crisis. Conyers argues that the shut-offs violate international human rights law and could lead to a public health crisis.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "\n\nThe European Court of Justice has ruled against Nestlé's attempt to trademark the shape of its four-finger Kit Kat bars in the EU. The decision came after a long-standing dispute with Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury's chocolate, which argued that the shape was not distinctive enough to be granted trademark protection. The case began in 2002 and has cost both companies millions of dollars in legal fees.\n\nThe Kit Kat bar, which was first introduced in the UK in 1935, has been a popular snack in Europe for decades. However, the shape of the bar, which consists of four fingers, is not unique as Mondelez also produces a similar product, the Leo bar, which has a similar shape. The European Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) rejected Nestlé's application in 2017, but the company appealed the decision.\n\nThe ruling could have implications for other food and beverage companies that have sought to trademark the shape of their products in the EU. The case hinged on whether the shape of the Kit Kat bar was distinctive enough to be considered a trademark. The court found that the shape was not distinctive enough on its own and that consumers primarily associate the shape with the product's function.\n\nThe decision was welcomed by Mondelez, which argued that the trademark would have limited the company's ability to produce similar products. However, Nestlé has not ruled out the possibility of appealing the decision or seeking protection for the shape of the Kit Kat bar in other markets.\n\nThe dispute between Nestlé and Mondelez is not the only legal battle between the two companies. In the UK, Nestlé has objected to Mondelez's trademark for the purple color used on Cadbury's Dairy Milk bars. The case is still ongoing.\n\nThe long-running legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez over the shape of the Kit Kat bar is a reminder of the complexities of intellectual property law and the importance of protecting trademarks. The case also highlights the importance of considering the function of a product when determining whether it is eligible for trademark protection.\n\nThe ruling could also have implications for other food and beverage companies that have sought to trademark the shape of their products in the EU.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

Police, who have described the deaths as \"suspicious,\" revealed Sunday that the cause of death for both Shermans was \"ligature neck compression,\" a form of strangulation, the CBC reports. Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "\n\nEgyptians went to the polls for the final round of parliamentary elections on January 2, 2012, while former President Hosni Mubarak faced prosecution in court. In the trial, Chief Prosecutor Mustafa Suleiman accused Mubarak of imposing a corrupt regime and called for the harshest penalty. The election, the first since Mubarak's ouster in February 2011, saw the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafist Al-Nour Party leading in the polls. The new parliament is expected to face challenges in forming a government and addressing economic issues, including slowing growth and high unemployment. Protests continued in Cairo, calling for the military council to hand over power to a civilian government. The trial of Mubarak and his sons, Gamal and Alaa, resumed after a three-month hiatus, with the prosecution presenting evidence of corruption and abuse of power. The defendants, who have all pleaded not guilty, are facing charges of conspiring to kill protesters during the uprising that led to Mubarak's downfall. The trial is seen as a test of Egypt's commitment to accountability and transparency. The military council, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak's ouster, has faced criticism for its handling of the transition and its refusal to set a clear timeline for elections. The United States and other Western powers have called for a swift transfer of power to a civilian government. The situation in Egypt remains uncertain, with ongoing political instability and economic challenges.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
