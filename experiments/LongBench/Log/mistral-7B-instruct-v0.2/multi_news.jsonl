MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections and is often resistant to antibiotics.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time being killed by macrophages, immune cells that engulf and destroy bacteria. The smoke extract made MRSA more resistant to reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria, and antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense. MRSA was also able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, making it more successful in its invasion. The more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became.\n\nThe second study, also published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, enhancing its survival against reactive oxygen species. MRSA exposed to smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, meaning a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendants in 12 hours.\n\nThe studies were conducted to examine an alternative theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker, but instead, smoke makes the pathogen tougher.

The condition affects the spinal cord and can lead to limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The exact trigger is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment. AFM has been linked to enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The best prevention is to wash hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect against mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is also linked to AFM.\n\nIn 2014, there were 120 cases of AFM reported between August and December, all children, with an average age of 7 and many requiring ventilator support. Although 85% of the children recovered partially, only three have fully recovered. The cause of the 2014 outbreak was not definitively determined, but it coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Some doctors believe that EV-D68 may be the cause of the current rise in cases.\n\nThe CDC is investigating the current rise in AFM cases and advises people to take general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces to prevent viral infections. If a child appears to have a sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs, caregivers should contact a healthcare provider for assessment. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report patients meeting the case definition to their state or local health department.\n\nOne family affected by AFM is the Roberts family from Chesterfield, Virginia. Three-year-old Carter Roberts was a typical, healthy child before he suddenly developed the condition in July 2016. He is now only able to move the left side of his face and wiggle a toe.

The investigation revealed inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns, suggesting that the shroud may be a fake.\n\nThe shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has long been a subject of debate and study. It is regarded by the Vatican as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and has been analyzed for decades. More than 2 million people came to see the shroud during a three-month display in 2015, including Pope Francis.\n\nThe researchers used real and synthetic blood samples on cloth to test the orientation of stains on the shroud. They hoped to answer the debate over the crucifixion depicted on the cloth, but instead found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose. This suggests that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back.\n\nIf the shroud were a genuine death shroud of a crucified person, the bloodstains should not be so inconsistent, according to Borrini. They conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric: the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, along with a belt of blood at the waist. The researchers discovered that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part.\n\nThe findings of the investigation have raised questions about the authenticity of the shroud and added to evidence that it may be a medieval fraud.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The effects on infants are particularly chronic, with many failing to thrive or dying.\n\nThe solution to this problem is not to make institutions more comfortable, but to eliminate them altogether. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 through investment in inclusive education and health, support for vulnerable families, and fostering, adoption, or other family-based care alternatives for children who cannot be with their parents.\n\nInternational donors play a vital role in this effort, as their funding choices and principles greatly influence the support available to children and families.

{"pred": "\n\nIn her upcoming memoir, \"Forgetting to Be Afraid,\" Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis reveals two personal stories that shaped her life and political career: the termination of a much-wanted pregnancy and an ectopic pregnancy. In the first instance, Davis and her then-husband made the difficult decision to end a pregnancy after discovering their unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. Doctors told them the syndrome would cause the baby to suffer and likely be incompatible with life. After getting several medical opinions and feeling the baby tremble violently in the womb, they made the heart-wrenching decision to terminate the pregnancy. Davis writes that she and her husband spent time with their baby, named Tate Elise, the day after her delivery and had her baptized. They cried, took photographs, and said their goodbyes. The experience left Davis with an indescribable blackness, a deep, dark despair and grief that made her wonder if she would ever surface.\n\nIn the second instance, Davis experienced an ectopic pregnancy in 1994, which was technically considered an abortion and required doctors to report it as such. Such pregnancies are generally not viable, and terminating them is considered medically necessary to save the mother's life. Davis' filibuster in the Texas Senate in 2013, which temporarily delayed the passing of sweeping new abortion restrictions, was a pivotal moment in her political career. She recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. Davis' hands shook, and she wiped tears from her eyes as she related to the woman's story.\n\nDavis' memoir goes on sale to the general public on Tuesday, and she will be signing copies at a Fort Worth bookstore on Monday. The book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote: \"Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.\" Abortion rights have been a major undercurrent in the race for governor between Davis and Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Governor Rick Perry.

The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

{"pred": "\n\nTwo recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer, during pregnancy. The first study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar issues. The researchers cautioned that this doesn't mean that taking acetaminophen once will cause ADHD, but advised pregnant women to avoid chronic or long-term use. The second study, also published in JAMA Pediatrics, found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with ADHD-like behaviors or being prescribed ADHD medications. However, the researchers emphasized that their results did not show a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nBoth studies have received mixed reactions from experts. Some believe that the findings warrant further investigation, while others caution against jumping to conclusions. Dr. Beate Ritz, the lead author of the first study, advises pregnant women to try to avoid taking painkillers as much as possible until more is known about the potential risks. Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital, suggests nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.\n\nAcetaminophen is widely used during pregnancy due to its perceived safety, but the studies have highlighted the importance of not taking its safety for granted. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol, has issued a statement saying that there is no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\n\nIt's important to note that ADHD diagnoses are on the rise, and more than 1 in 10 children have been diagnosed with ADHD. However, the causes of ADHD are complex, and it's likely that there are multiple risk factors, including genetic and environmental factors.\n\nThe studies have also raised questions about the potential mechanisms by which acetaminophen might increase the risk of ADHD. One theory is that it may interfere with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development.

However, Senate Democrats and President Obama have vowed to reject any changes to the health law, and the Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, close to the midnight deadline for passing legislation to avoid a shutdown.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance against House Republicans, urging Obama to cancel a planned meeting with the four congressional leaders at the White House. Reid believes that such a meeting would only give the false impression of a serious negotiation and that Republicans would demand even bigger concessions on a long-term bill if Democrats give any ground on a short-term stopgap funding measure.\n\nThe economic impact of a government shutdown would be particularly severe in the Washington D.C. region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation. An estimated $200 million a day could be lost, and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. Federal services such as Medicare, Social Security, and child-care subsidies could be halted, and federally funded attractions like museums and battlefields could be closed.\n\nRepublicans, led by House Speaker John Boehner, have accused Reid of wanting a shutdown for political purposes and have called on the Senate to return to session and negotiate.

The mission, which is scheduled to launch in July 2018, will perform 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within 3.9 million miles of the solar surface. The spacecraft will be equipped with a 7.5-foot-wide, 4.5-inch-thick heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material and will carry four science instruments to measure the sun's electric and magnetic fields, photograph solar structure, and study the solar wind. The mission aims to answer two long-standing puzzles: how is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, so much hotter than the solar surface? Understanding these questions is important for protecting equipment from solar radiation and could potentially save billions of dollars in damage. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first mission to the sun and its outermost atmosphere, called the corona, and will carry a chip with photographs of Parker and his revolutionary paper predicting the existence of solar wind. The mission was initially called Solar Probe Plus but was renamed to honor Parker, who is still alive and was present at the announcement. The Parker Solar Probe will revolutionize mankind's understanding of the sun and the origins of physics and could also help protect equipment from solar radiation.

The lion had escaped from Nairobi National Park and was surrounded by hundreds of onlookers before the attack occurred. Veterinary teams were en route with tranquilizers when the situation escalated, prompting rangers to shoot the lion to save lives. In South Africa, a 3-year-old male lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park and was being hunted after officials deemed him a threat to humans. Wildlife experts were considering various options, including relocating the lion to another park or donating it to a conservation group.\n\nThe incidents highlight the delicate balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders.

The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds. Of course, employees will have to plan their leave with managers and coworkers in advance to make sure their absence isn't disruptive—behaving, you know, like adults.

The researchers have not yet observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects. The planet is believed to have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are currently searching for the object.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto, which spent three-quarters of a century as the iconic ninth planet, was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to Brown's observations of the outer solar system. Brown has been working on finding a new planet to replace Pluto for his daughter, who was disappointed by its demotion.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine is still a big unknown, and further observations and detections of perturbed bodies would bolster the hypothesis. NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system. However, he is personally excited about the new research.\n\nBrown and Batygin initially set out to prove that Planet Nine didn't exist but ultimately concluded that the best explanation for the smaller objects' clustering was the gravitational effects of something far bigger. The clustering is similar to what's seen in some asteroids that are about as close to the sun as the Earth.\n\nThe situation mimics what happened in the 19th century when careful observation of the seventh planet, Uranus, indicated that there must be another body in far-distant space influencing its orbit, leading eventually to the discovery of Neptune.\n\nIf and when it's spotted, Planet Nine would be evaluated by the same criteria that got Pluto demoted. Brown is confident that it will be considered a planet due to its gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects and its size, which is", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased, often due to cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nPrevious studies have associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. However, new research reveals that the health consequences of repeatedly losing and gaining weight may be even more severe for individuals with coronary heart disease.

As the forecast coordinator for the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Louisiana, responsible for New Orleans, he knew he had to convey the urgency and seriousness of the situation to the public. Ricks came up with a bold and effective solution: a dire weather forecast warning of unprecedented destruction and human suffering. The forecast, which included statements like \"most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks, perhaps longer,\" and \"water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards,\" was issued the day before the storm made landfall. The forecast, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, was considered by many to be the most dire and effective weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service.\n\nAt the time, evacuations were underway and people were starting to arrive at the Superdome. Ricks knew he had one last chance to get the message out. He sat down at his desk and using computers, history, and his fellow forecasters, he wrote the extraordinary bulletin titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE.\" The document predicted devastating damage, including roof and wall failure for most homes, total defoliation of trees, and water shortages leading to incredible human suffering.\n\nRicks' forecast was right, and the images of devastation that followed made it clear. The lifelong resident of New Orleans, who grew up in the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward section of the city, was back at work alongside co-workers who had no homes and were wearing the clothes they wore that day. Ricks, who had experienced Hurricanes Betsy and Camille in the past, was devastated by the response, but he had done everything in his power to warn people of the monster storm coming their way.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The first article, published on Live Science, focused on a new paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago. Hooper's paper revived the idea of Kardashev's three types of technologically advanced civilizations and added a new, apocalyptic twist. According to Hooper, as the universe expands at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, stars beyond our Local Group will become unobservable and inaccessible, limiting the amount of energy that could be extracted from them. To prevent this, advanced civilizations would capture and harvest stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible.\n\nThe second article, while not directly related to Hooper's paper, discussed the concept of Dyson spheres, which are colossal structures that could permanently hover around a star and beam energy back to a nearby planet. This idea was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in a scientific paper in 1960 and later popularized in science fiction. Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of solar-powered satellites, also known as statites, which would hover in space and form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nBoth articles emphasized the importance of energy in advanced alien civilizations and the need to expand beyond their home planet and star to access more resources. The idea of harvesting energy from distant stars to prevent isolation in the vastness of space was presented as a way for civilizations to maximize their ability to utilize energy and survive the inevitable expansion of the universe.\n\nOverall, the news articles highlight the ongoing fascination with the possibility of advanced alien civilizations and the various ways they might be recognized or detected, such as their waste heat or unusual light signatures. The idea of harvesting energy from stars to prevent isolation and expand into other galaxies adds a new dimension to the search for extraterrestrial life and raises intriguing questions about the potential motivations and capabilities of advanced alien civilizations.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

When Kilborn left to host a late-night talk show on ABC, Comedy Central executives moved The Daily Show to 11 PM to counter-program local news and reach younger male viewers. Kilborn's departure created an opportunity for Stewart to take over as host in 1999.\n\nStewart brought in new writers and staff members, including Ben Karlin and David Javerbaum, to help shape the show's direction.

The findings challenge the belief that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly arose during a \"human revolution\" 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, researchers now suggest that these behaviors emerged in response to long-term, global environmental and climatic changes around 300,000 years ago.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, which was once a series of floodplains, underwent significant climate changes and developed into a vast arid grassland with unpredictable food sources. To adapt, human populations needed to become more mobile, gather and share information, and innovate.\n\nExcavations at five sites dating from 320,000 years ago revealed distinct differences in stone tool forms compared to older deposits in the area. The sites contained much smaller, standardized pieces such as points and blades, some modified for hafting. Many of these tools were made on obsidian, which came from 25-50 km away, and some from further afield. The team also discovered bright red ochre pigment with evidence of grinding and cut marks, marking the earliest known pigments used to color rocks in the archaeological record.\n\nThe absence or rarity of large cutting tools and the presence of prepared core technologies for making sophisticated points and blades characterize the Middle Stone Age across Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Robyn Adamson, who portrayed the wife in the film, recalled that the girl reacted strangely during the photoshoot, and later, when she was told about the incident, she knew exactly what had happened.\n\nCasting director Catrine McGregor filed a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild legal department and advocated for Sizemore's immediate dismissal from the project. The producers of the film removed him from the set as soon as they heard about the allegation but found the photographs from the portrait session inconclusive. They also spoke to Sizemore and encouraged him to engage with law enforcement if he felt compelled to do so.\n\nDespite the allegation, the producers invited Sizemore to Malibu for reshoots a couple of months later due to their fiduciary responsibility to complete the film.

His parents, David and Louise, supported his decision to undergo the surgery, which was primarily cosmetic but also aimed to boost his confidence.\n\nDuring the six-hour operation, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, cartilage was harvested from both sides of Kieran's chest and shaped into frameworks for his new ears.

The ocean, which was a mile deep in places, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This new finding challenges the previous belief that water was an erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only occasionally and never forming long-standing seas and oceans.\n\nThe evidence for the ancient ocean comes from atmospheric maps of water and its deuterated form (HDO) across the martian globe. These maps reveal strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment, indicating great water loss. The released water has a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth’s ocean (VSMOW). The atmospheric maps also indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, suggesting that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nThe scientists used three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world, including the Keck II telescope, Nasa’s Infrared Telescope Facility, and the ESO’s Very Large Telescope, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons.\n\nThe infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the more water has been lost. This loss of water led to the formation of an ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. However, it is believed that the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet’s surface.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars adds to the emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "\n\nThe European Court of Justice has overturned a decision made by the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2012, which granted Nestlé the trademark for the shape of its Kit Kat four-finger wafer bars. The ruling came after an appeal by Mondelez, which argued that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked across all EU member states. The court found that Nestlé had failed to provide sufficient evidence that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive. The case has been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has also been a topic of debate in the Brexit discussion, with some suggesting that EU courts have failed to protect British treats. The dispute between Nestlé and Mondelez is not the only one involving chocolate giants and trademarks. In the UK, Nestlé objected to Cadbury's trademark for the purple color used to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The case has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The outcome leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could take account of other evidence and preserve protection for KitKat's shape. Nestlé and Mondelez have both been global chocolate giants for decades, with Nestlé buying Rowntree's, the original Kit Kat maker, in 1988, and Mondelez acquiring Cadbury in 2010. The Kit Kat has been a popular snack since its introduction in 1935, while Kvikk Lunsj, a Norwegian four-finger wafer bar, has been around since 1937. The two treats lived together in harmony for decades until Nestlé went on the offensive in 2002, applying for a trademark for the shape of a Kit Kat in Europe.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent discoveries, scientists have challenged the common perception of dinosaurs as roaring beasts, suggesting instead that some may have cooed or mumbled with closed mouths. A study published in the journal Evolution indicates that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are sounds produced through an esophageal pouch while keeping the beak closed, have evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, the group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers analyzed the vocal behaviors of various bird species and found that only large-bodied birds, such as doves or ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalizations. This association with large body size is due to the physics of inflation, as smaller bodies require more lung pressure to inflate a cavity.\n\nThe study also sheds light on the vocal abilities of dinosaurs, as they were members of the archosaur group. Although no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like, the occurrence of closed-mouth vocalization across birds and crocodiles suggests that this behavior could have emerged in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, in the world of entertainment, the new blockbuster \"Jurassic World\" has reignited public interest in dinosaurs. However, the iconic roars heard in the film are not based on any scientific evidence, as the true sounds of dinosaurs remain a mystery. The roars in the movie were created using a combination of animal sounds, such as elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and gargling alligators.\n\nIn other news, researchers at the University of Texas and Midwestern University have received a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to study the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the large array of sounds it can produce. This collaboration aims to provide insights into the vocal abilities of dinosaurs and their descendants.\n\nFinally, the Internet Archive has made available a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The Bayesian approach allows for all theories to be considered and weighted, and it is flexible enough to be updated with new information. In the case of the Air France search, the statisticians initially assumed that the black box would be emitting a signal in 90% of cases, but when no signal was detected, they adapted their model to the possibility that the black box was not sending a signal. This led them to a new area of highest probability, where the plane was eventually found. Thomas Bayes, a British Presbyterian minister, is credited with developing the principles of Bayesian probability, which are used all over the world in various applications, including financial markets and weather forecasting. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is ongoing, and it is uncertain whether the plane will be found. Even if debris is found, it may not be very helpful in locating the bulk of the plane.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found. Bayesian techniques have helped people find World War II U-boats, men overboard, and sunken treasure, but there's no evidence that Malaysia is employing them now. \"I suspect that they just guess, like professional baseball managers used to do before Moneyball,\" says a biostatistician."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3727}

This event hasn't occurred for over 150 years and will be visible from Australia, western USA, and some parts of eastern Asia.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project, based in Italy, will be partnering with several astrophotographers from Australia, the USA, and South Africa to bring this event to viewers online for free.

Additionally, the project will show the Supermoon rising above Rome's legendary monuments later the same day, starting at 16:00 UT.\n\nThe first eclipse of 2018 will also be a lunar one, which takes place at the end of January. It will be a total eclipse and will be visible from Central and Eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and most of Australia. The Pacific Ocean will be turned toward the moon during this event. The duration of the total phase is 77 minutes.\n\nBlue Moon total lunar eclipses are rare, with the next one not occurring until December 31, 2028, and the one after that on January 31, 2037. Both of these eclipses will be total.

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

The USA leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's obese population, but other countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands, also have high obesity rates. The causes of obesity are complex and include the availability of cheap, high-calorie junk food and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity is a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and kills about 3.4 million adults annually. The number of overweight and obese people has increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children over the past 33 years. The problem is not limited to rich countries; it is affecting people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with not one country succeeding in cutting its obesity rate. The biggest increases in obesity among women were seen in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while among men, it was in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The problem is most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women are overweight or obese. The report notes that obesity is not just a cosmetic issue, but a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Obesity is appearing at increasingly young ages, with rates rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. The rate of increase in adult obesity has slowed in rich countries, but the problem is still a major concern.
