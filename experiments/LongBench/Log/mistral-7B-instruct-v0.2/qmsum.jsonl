{"pred": "Kirsty Williams acknowledged that there has been a trend of under-recruiting to about 65% of priority places in Welsh teacher training centres. She attributed this to a combination of factors, including the lack of financial incentives and the international issue of teacher recruitment and retention. To address this, they have implemented new financial incentives, set up an advisory board on recruitment and retention, and launched a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. They are also part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment and have increased the number of part-time PGCE places to give people the opportunity to earn while they learn.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce."], "all_classes": null, "length": 13883}

They noted that using advanced chips and an LCD display would increase the costs significantly.

Ultimately, they decided to explore both options, with one design featuring a scroll wheel and a regular chip, and the other design featuring an LCD display and an advanced chip.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
