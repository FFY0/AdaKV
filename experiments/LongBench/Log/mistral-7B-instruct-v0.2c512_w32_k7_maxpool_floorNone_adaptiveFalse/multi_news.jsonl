Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The house, which is made of timber and clay, is remarkably well-preserved and is even levelled with the ground, making it almost invisible. The site also includes a large henge monument, which is believed to have been one of the biggest and most impressive in Britain during the Neolithic period.\n\nAt Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age child's skeleton was discovered. Archaeologists believe the child was buried with great care and respect, as evidenced by the presence of a pot and a flint knife in the grave. This discovery is significant because it provides valuable insights into the lives of the people who lived in the area during the Bronze Age.\n\nBoth sites are part of the Vale of Pewsey, an area that has been neglected in archaeological research despite its proximity to Stonehenge and Avebury. The discoveries at these sites will help researchers better understand the people who lived in the area during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages and the role these sites played in the wider landscape.\n\nThe Vale of Pewsey is home to many prehistoric sites, including several henges and burial mounds. Archaeologists believe that these sites were important religious and ceremonial centers for the people who lived in the area during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

According to recent studies, one in every seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50. This trend challenges the current guidelines that recommend screening for this disease starting at age 50.\n\nThe University of Michigan conducted an extensive analysis of data from 1998 to 2011, revealing that younger patients accounted for 15% of all colorectal cancer cases. These patients were more likely to have advanced stages of the disease and poorer outcomes compared to older patients.\n\nSymptoms of colorectal cancer include dark stools, blood in the stool, unexplained weight loss, and abdominal pain. However, many younger patients may not exhibit these symptoms, making early detection challenging.\n\nThe study also found that younger patients received less aggressive treatment and were less likely to undergo surgery compared to older patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "\n\nIn the realm of space exploration and advanced civilizations, several intriguing concepts have emerged in recent news. First, the idea of expanding a civilization beyond its home planet and harvesting resources from other stars has been revisited through the lens of Nikolai Kardashev's 1962 model of advanced civilizations. This model proposes three types of civilizations based on their energy consumption: Type I (consuming all resources on their planet), Type II (harnessing all the energy from their star), and Type III (harnessing all the energy in their galaxy). A recent paper by Dan Hooper revived this model and added an apocalyptic twist, suggesting that advanced civilizations might be racing against time to capture energy from distant stars before they become inaccessible due to the universe's expansion.\n\nMeanwhile, the search for advanced alien civilizations continues, with scientists and science fiction authors pondering the possibility of detecting their mega-structures, such as Dyson spheres. These structures would allow advanced civilizations to harness the energy of their star more efficiently. Freeman Dyson, an astrophysicist, and science fiction author Olaf Stapledon have contributed to the discussion of Dyson spheres and their potential existence.\n\nAdditionally, the Internet Archive has made available a collection of data related to WARCZone, which may contain valuable information regarding certain websites. This data could potentially provide clues to ongoing research or discoveries related to advanced civilizations or space exploration.\n\nIn summary, the news covers the revival of an old model of advanced civilizations, the search for alien civilizations through the detection of their mega-structures, and the availability of data related to potential discoveries in the field of space exploration. The race against time to harness the energy of distant stars and the potential existence of Dyson spheres highlight the ongoing fascination with the possibilities of advanced civilizations in the universe.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Instead, the research suggests that technologically advanced behaviors and innovations emerged much earlier, around 320,000 years ago, in Africa.\n\nThe first study, based on excavations in Kenya, uncovered stone tools and artifacts that indicate early humans were capable of complex behaviors such as making and using standardized tools, as well as trading and exchanging resources. These findings challenge the previous belief that such behaviors only emerged with the arrival of modern humans.\n\nThe second study, also from Kenya, revealed that climate change may have played a role in driving the development of advanced behaviors. The researchers found evidence of a wetter climate around 320,000 years ago, which could have led to increased mobility and resource availability, leading to the need for more sophisticated tools and social structures.\n\nThe third study, from South Africa, discovered the oldest known example of a symbolic representation, a bone tool that had been modified to resemble a bird. This finding suggests that symbolic thinking and abstract thought processes were present much earlier than previously believed.\n\nThese discoveries challenge the Eurocentric view of human evolution and highlight the importance of Africa as a cradle of human innovation.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

However, many people on social media and in the tech community have mocked this statement, calling it hubris, stupidity, and even arrogance.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack means that users will have to use wireless headphones or the Lightning port to listen to music or other audio content. Apple included a pair of Lightning EarPods and an adapter for regular headphones in the box with each new iPhone.\n\nThe lack of a headphone jack has also raised concerns about the convenience and practicality of the new design. Some users have expressed frustration about having to carry around additional cables and adapters, especially when traveling.\n\nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus also feature improved cameras, water resistance, and longer battery life.

{"pred": "\n\nRecent studies suggest that Mars had a significant amount of water on its surface in the past, making it a potentially habitable planet for early life. According to a study published in Science, researchers have found strong isotopic anomalies in Martian water, indicating that ancient Mars had a deep global ocean, possibly up to 137 meters deep. Another study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, reveals that Mars once had a massive northern ocean that covered nearly half of its northern hemisphere. This ocean existed around 3.7 billion years ago and was approximately 1 kilometer deep.\n\nThe evidence for ancient Martian oceans comes from the analysis of atmospheric gases and isotopic ratios. The researchers found that the atmospheric gases on Mars, specifically methane and water vapor, were once produced by a large body of water. Additionally, the isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in the Martian atmosphere suggest that there was once a significant amount of water on the planet.\n\nThese findings challenge the previous belief that Mars was a dry and arid planet. Instead, it appears that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with conditions suitable for life. The discovery of ancient oceans on Mars adds to the growing body of evidence that the planet may have once harbored life.\n\nThe search for life on Mars continues, with NASA planning several missions to explore the planet's surface and search for signs of past or present life.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court found that the shape of the Kit Kat bar does not have distinctiveness, as it is not unique or capable of distinguishing the product from others on the market. Nestlé had been fighting for over a decade to protect the shape of the Kit Kat bar, which is known for its teatime association. The decision comes after Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, objected to the trademark. The case has been ongoing since 2007, with Nestlé initially being granted the trademark in 2010, but it was later revoked in 2013. The ruling could potentially impact other food products with distinctive shapes, such as the Leo bar and the Cadbury Dairy Milk bar, which have also been the subject of trademark disputes. The decision was welcomed by Mondelez, which had argued that the trademark would limit competition and stifle innovation in the chocolate industry. The case has been closely watched by trademark lawyers and industry experts, who see it as a significant ruling in the area of intellectual property law. The Kit Kat bar, which was first introduced in the UK in 1935, is a popular snack in many countries and is known for its distinctive shape and slogan \"Have a break, have a Kit Kat.\" The ruling does not affect the trademark for the name \"Kit Kat\" or the brand's logo. The case is not the first time that Nestlé has faced challenges to its intellectual property rights.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent discoveries, scientists have challenged the popular perception of how dinosaurs sounded. According to new research, dinosaurs likely vocalized with closed mouths, producing quieter and more varied sounds than the roars commonly depicted in movies and media. This theory is based on the study of modern birds, which share a common ancestry with dinosaurs.\n\nThe misconception of dinosaurs' roaring stems from Hollywood portrayals, which have influenced public imagination for decades. However, a study published in the journal Current Biology suggests that birds, as descendants of dinosaurs, use closed mouths to produce a range of sounds, from songs to calls. This behavior is thought to have been present in their extinct ancestors as well.\n\nAdditionally, a recent study published in the journal Evolutionary Biology found that T. rex and other large dinosaurs may have had feathers, further challenging the traditional image of these animals. This discovery, combined with the new understanding of their vocalizations, paints a more complex and nuanced picture of dinosaur behavior and biology.\n\nThe researchers behind the vocalization study analyzed the anatomy and behavior of modern birds to infer how their dinosaur ancestors might have vocalized. They found that the syrinx, a vocal organ unique to birds, is capable of producing a wide range of sounds when the mouth is closed. This ability allows birds to communicate effectively in various environments and situations.\n\nThe researchers suggest that dinosaurs, particularly large species, may have used closed-mouth vocalizations for various purposes, such as mating displays, warning signals, or social communication. These sounds could have been quieter and more subtle than the loud roars often portrayed in popular culture.\n\nThe study also sheds light on the evolution of vocal communication in birds and their dinosaur ancestors. The researchers believe that the ability to produce a wide range of sounds with a closed mouth evolved early in the history of birds and was likely present in their dinosaur ancestors as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the new research challenges the long-held belief that dinosaurs roared loudly and opens up exciting possibilities for understanding their behavior and communication.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The report also criticized the Obama administration for providing misleading information to the public about the nature of the attack in the days following the incident.\n\nThe release of the report came after a contentious and partisan investigation process, with Democrats accusing Republicans of politicizing the issue for political gain. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the ranking member of the committee, called the investigation one of the \"saddest\" experiences of his career and criticized the panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), for trying to prevent Democrats from accessing the report.\n\nThe report also found that there was no evidence of a stand-down order given to military personnel during the attack, as some Republicans had claimed. The committee also debunked the theory that the attack was a result of a protest over an anti-Muslim video, stating that it was a planned terrorist attack.\n\nThe report's release comes at a critical time for the 2016 presidential race, with Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack, set to be the Democratic nominee.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

{"pred": "\n\nEgyptians went to the polls for the third and final round of parliamentary elections on January 2, 2012, while former President Hosni Mubarak faced prosecution in court. In the trial, Chief Prosecutor Mustafa Suleiman accused Mubarak of imposing a corrupt regime and passing power to his son Gamal. The final round of elections saw Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, expected to gain a significant number of seats. The election process has been marred by violence and allegations of irregularities. Prosecutors began presenting their case against Mubarak and 10 other defendants on January 3, 2012. Mubarak, who is currently in detention, is charged with corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising. The trial is taking place amid growing opposition to the military council's rule and calls for the speedy transition to civilian government. The economic situation in Egypt also remains dire, with slowing growth and high unemployment. The parliamentary elections are seen as a crucial step towards democratic governance, but the outcome and the transition process remain uncertain.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
