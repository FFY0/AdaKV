The researchers, Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Pseudosciences, conducted experiments using real and synthetic blood to study the flow of blood on the fabric. They found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the angle and position of a person standing upright or lying down on the fabric.

The Shroud of Turin has long been a subject of debate and fascination, with some believing it to be a sacred relic and others viewing it as a fake. The latest investigation adds to the ongoing debate, but it is important to note that the authenticity of the shroud has not been definitively proven or disproven.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Following this, more than a dozen men came forward with similar allegations, some of which date back to the late 1980s.\n\nOne of the accusers is Jon Bernthal, who worked with Spacey on the film \"Baby Driver.\" Bernthal told SiriusXM that he had lost respect for Spacey after observing his behavior on set. He recalled feeling uncomfortable around Spacey and noted that others had also expressed concerns about his conduct. Bernthal did not witness any of the alleged sexual misconduct himself, but he did share his experiences and observations.\n\nSpacey's legal team has not yet responded to the allegations. However, on October 30, 2017, Spacey issued a statement in response to Rapp's allegation, in which he apologized for any inappropriate behavior and claimed that he did not remember the incident.

The house, which is believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period ever found in the UK, will welcome visitors during an open day as part of the national festival of archaeology. The site also includes a large enclosure, believed to have been used for demonstrating wealth and power.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child wearing an amber necklace was discovered. Scientific analysis will provide information on the child's gender, diet, and date of burial, potentially shedding light on their origins.\n\nThe Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

The tax also faced opposition from the beverage industry and retailers, who warned of job losses. Cook County, Illinois, repealed its soda tax last year due to public backlash and revenue shortfalls. Washington state, which has a reputation for social engineering, is a hotbed for such taxes.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission, set to launch in summer 2018, will come closer to the sun's surface than any previous spacecraft, providing valuable data on solar wind, solar radiation, and solar particles. The probe is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its effects on the solar system. The mission was previously known as the Solar Probe Plus. Parker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, made groundbreaking predictions about solar wind in the 1950s, which were later confirmed by spacecraft observations. He will be present at the launch and will receive a commemorative plaque. The probe will be protected by a heat shield capable of withstanding temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission is expected to last for seven years and will provide crucial information for improving space weather forecasting and protecting satellites and astronauts from solar radiation. The probe will also study the sun's magnetic fields and solar wind interactions with the magnetic fields of Mercury.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer, followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over five years, recording their weight an average of 12 times. The researchers found that those in the highest weight variability group had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 116% higher risk of heart attack, a 132% higher risk of stroke, and a 147% higher risk of death compared to those in the lowest weight variability group.\n\nCoronary artery disease is a condition that develops when the major blood vessels supplying the heart become damaged or diseased, often due to plaque buildup and inflammation. The condition can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, and other serious health complications.\n\nPrevious research has linked yo-yo dieting to increased risk of poor heart health. However, new research indicates that the health consequences of repeatedly losing and gaining weight may be even more severe for individuals with pre-existing heart disease.

According to a study led by the University of Michigan, one in every seven colorectal cancer patients in the U.S. is under the age of 50. This trend raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. The study found that younger patients are more likely to have advanced cancer when diagnosed and undergo more aggressive treatments. Despite this, younger patients overall had better survival rates than older patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The first article, published on Live Science, explores the idea of advanced civilizations harvesting energy from distant stars to prevent being left alone in the expanding universe due to dark energy. According to astrophysicist Dan Hooper, this is a necessity for any civilization that wants to expand and grow. Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations may already be capturing stars to prevent them from becoming inaccessible due to the expanding universe.\n\nThe second article discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical megastructures that could be used by advanced civilizations to capture and harness the energy of their star. This concept was first introduced by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" and later popularized by physicist Freeman Dyson. Dyson spheres could potentially allow civilizations to become Type III civilizations, according to Nikolai Kardashev's scale, which is the highest level of civilization in terms of energy consumption.\n\nBoth articles highlight the potential for advanced civilizations to harness vast amounts of energy to fuel their growth and expansion.

These tools include small, prepared cores, which require advanced planning and technological skills, as well as the use of exotic materials.\n\nThe researchers propose that these technological innovations were driven by environmental changes and the need for greater mobility. They suggest that the Homo heidelbergensis population in Africa, which is the common ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans, may have been the first to exhibit these behaviors.\n\nThe studies also challenge the Eurocentric view that modern human behaviors originated outside of Africa and were brought back by migrating humans. Instead, the evidence suggests that Africa was the cradle of modern human behavior.\n\nThe findings have important implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behaviors. They challenge the notion of a sudden \"human revolution\" and suggest that complex behaviors evolved gradually over a long period of time.\n\nThe researchers also emphasize the importance of continuing to explore Africa's rich archaeological record to better understand the origins of modern human behaviors.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

The incident occurred in March 2014 when the panda, which was being chased by other villagers, entered Guan's land and bit him in the leg. The attack left Guan with severe injuries that required seven hours of surgery and may necessitate further operations. The panda escaped after the attack.

They are under pressure due to habitat loss and have a notoriously low reproductive rate. The number of wild giant pandas rose nearly 17 percent over the decade to 2013, reaching 1,864, according to a government survey.

The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "\n\nRecent studies suggest that Mars once had a significant amount of water, potentially enough to cover nearly half of its northern hemisphere, making it a more promising place for alien life. According to researchers at NASA, atmospheric water and its isotopic composition indicate that Mars experienced great water loss, with water ice reservoirs enriched in heavy isotopes. This implies that early Mars had a deep global water layer, at least 137 meters deep. Furthermore, evidence from NASA's Nasa scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean covered a fifth of Mars' surface around 4.5 billion years ago. This ocean was at least a mile deep, and its existence challenges the previous belief that Mars was a dry and arid planet. The findings come from analyzing the Martian atmosphere's hydrogen and deuterium isotopes, which revealed that Mars had a significant amount of water in its past. The researchers used data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft and the Hubble Space Telescope to make their discoveries. These findings add to the growing evidence that Mars was once a warmer and wetter planet, potentially habitable for life. The search for life on Mars will continue with upcoming missions, such as the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover, which is set to launch in 2018.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent studies, researchers have challenged the common perception of dinosaurs roaring with their terrifying, deep voices. Instead, they suggest that some dinosaurs may have vocalized with closed mouths, producing sounds similar to those of modern birds.\n\nThe first study, published in the journal \"Current Biology,\" revealed that T. rex and other dinosaurs likely did not produce the iconic roars heard in movies and documentaries. Instead, they may have made sounds using their lungs and vocal cords, similar to the coos and chirps of modern birds.\n\nA second study, published in the journal \"PLOS ONE,\" analyzed the vocalizations of various bird species and suggested that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalizations evolved in their ancestors, possibly dinosaurs. The researchers found that large-bodied birds, which are thought to have had dinosaur ancestors, are more likely to use closed-mouth vocalizations for mating displays.\n\nA third study, published in the journal \"Evolution,\" used statistical analysis to infer the vocal behaviors of extinct archosaurs, the group that includes dinosaurs and birds. The researchers found that the presence of closed-mouth vocalizations in modern birds and crocodiles suggests that some dinosaurs may have also used this vocalization method.\n\nThese findings challenge the popular image of dinosaurs as massive, roaring beasts. Instead, they suggest that dinosaurs may have had more complex vocalizations, including quieter, closed-mouth sounds used for communication and mating displays.\n\nThe researchers emphasized that while these studies provide important insights into the vocal behaviors of dinosaurs, more research is needed to fully understand their vocal capabilities. They plan to continue exploring this topic through a multidisciplinary approach, combining fossil evidence, experimental physiology, and computational modeling.\n\nIn summary, recent studies have challenged the long-held belief that dinosaurs roared loudly with deep voices.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

{"pred": "\n\nResearchers at UC Berkeley have made a significant breakthrough in understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences. By piecing together brain patterns as subjects watched YouTube videos, scientists were able to reconstruct the videos based on neural activity. This is the first time scientists have been able to read a continuous, dynamic visual experience from the brain. The researchers involved, Jack Gallant and Shinji Nishimoto, believe this technology could eventually lead to seeing into people's dreams, memories, and thoughts without visual stimulation. Gallant stated, \"We are opening a window into the movies in our minds.\"\n\nThe experiment involved subjects lying still inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos. The MRI recorded blood flow to the visual cortex, which was then matched with dynamic information from the videos. The algorithm learned to associate certain neural patterns with specific visual information, allowing for the reconstruction of the videos. The result was a blurry, dream-like interpretation of the actual videos.\n\nThis technology could potentially be used to broadcast imagery from a person's mind, offering a glimpse into their thoughts and experiences. Gallant noted, \"If you can decode movies people saw, you might be able to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog, like dreams.\"\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that this is only a small step towards mind reading, but it paves the way for further advancements in understanding the brain's visual processing. Gallant's team plans to explore more complex visual modules in the brain to improve resolution and accuracy.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast, ranging from allowing paralyzed individuals to control their environment through their thoughts to potentially being used in detective work or legal proceedings. However, ethical considerations and limitations, such as the fallibility of memories, must be addressed.\n\nIn summary, UC Berkeley researchers have successfully reconstructed YouTube videos based on brain activity, marking a significant step towards understanding the brain's visual processing and potentially opening a window into people's thoughts and experiences.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Statistical tools, specifically Bayesian inference, are being used to help refine the search area and potential explanations for the plane's disappearance. Bayesian inference is a statistical method that allows for the assessment of probabilities based on prior knowledge and new data. It has been used in past search and rescue operations, including the hunt for U-boats during World War II and the search for the missing Air France Flight 447 in 2009.\n\nIn the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Bayesian inference is being used to update the probability of the plane being in a particular location based on new data, such as the latest search results and information about the plane's last known communication. The method also allows for the assessment of different theories about the cause of the plane's disappearance, such as a mechanical failure or a deliberate act.\n\nThe use of Bayesian inference in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is not without challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of hard data about the plane's last moments, which makes it difficult to assign probabilities to different theories. Another challenge is the vast search area, which makes it difficult to cover all possible locations.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bayesian inference is seen as a valuable tool in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.
