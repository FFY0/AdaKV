The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The tax, which took effect on January 1, 2018, aimed to reduce sugar consumption, generate revenue for the city, and help low-income families afford healthier food options. However, the tax has faced significant opposition from businesses and consumers alike.\n\nAccording to reports, the tax has led to a surge in sales of bottled water and other beverages outside Seattle, as well as an increase in smuggling of sugary drinks into the city. Costco, a major retailer in the area, even considered moving its headquarters out of Seattle due to the financial burden caused by the tax.\n\nCritics argue that the tax is regressive and disproportionately affects low-income families, who spend a larger percentage of their income on beverages. They also claim that the tax does not address the root causes of obesity and other health issues, such as lack of access to healthy food options and physical activity.\n\nSupporters of the tax, however, argue that it is a necessary step to address the public health crisis caused by sugary beverages. They point to studies showing that sugary drinks are linked to a range of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. They also argue that the revenue generated from the tax can be used to fund programs that help low-income families access healthy food options.\n\nDespite these arguments, the tax has faced significant backlash. In January 2018, a coalition of businesses and individuals filed a referendum to repeal the tax.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

According to the first report from the University of California, Los Angeles, researchers found that pregnant women who frequently used acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase the risk of their children developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems. The second study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, revealed that acetaminophen use during pregnancy could be linked to ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders in children.\n\nThe UCLA study, which analyzed data from over 145,000 mother-child pairs, found that pregnant women who used acetaminophen for more than 20 days during pregnancy had a 29% increased risk of having a child with behavioral problems. The researchers also noted that the risk was higher for children whose mothers used acetaminophen for pain relief rather than fever reduction.\n\nThe second study, led by researchers at the University of Cincinnati, analyzed data from over 28,000 children and found that those whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy had a higher risk of developing ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The researchers also noted that the risk was higher for children whose mothers used acetaminophen in the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nDespite these findings, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) maintains that acetaminophen is still the safest pain reliever for pregnant women. However, both studies suggest that pregnant women should avoid using acetaminophen for extended periods and consider alternative methods for pain relief, such as massage, warm baths, and acupuncture.\n\nThe studies have not yet established a definitive link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Further research is needed to confirm the findings and determine the exact risk factors. In the meantime, pregnant women are advised to consult their healthcare providers before using any pain relievers and to explore non-pharmacological options for managing pain and discomfort.", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds. Of course, employees will have to plan their leave with managers and coworkers in advance to make sure their absence isn't disruptive—behaving, you know, like adults.

The team, led by astronomer Mike Brown, made the discovery based on the unusual orbits of several distant objects in the Kuiper Belt. Brown, who gained notoriety for his role in the demotion of Pluto from planet status in 2006, stated that the discovery of Planet Nine \"would be a really significant event.\"\n\nCaltech researchers have been studying the orbits of several distant objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of space beyond Neptune that is home to many dwarf planets and other icy bodies. They noticed that these objects all seemed to have elongated orbits that pointed in the same direction. This suggested the presence of a large, unseen planet that was gravitationally influencing their orbits.\n\nBrown and his team used computer simulations to model the effects of a large planet on the orbits of these objects. They found that the best fit for the data was a planet with a mass of 10 Earth masses and an orbit that takes it to the far reaches of the solar system, beyond Neptune and Pluto. The team plans to continue observing the orbits of these objects to gather more data and refine their calculations.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant event in astronomy, as it would help scientists better understand the dynamics of the outer solar system and the formation of planets in general.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

{"pred": "\n\nA new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that yo-yo dieting, or repeatedly losing and regaining weight, may increase the risk for heart attacks, strokes, and even death for individuals with coronary artery disease. The study, which followed over 9,000 people for 10 years, found that those who experienced the greatest weight fluctuations had a 50% higher risk of developing coronary artery disease compared to those with stable weight.\n\nThe study builds on previous research linking yo-yo dieting to poor heart health. Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of plaque. This can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, and strokes.\n\nThe exact mechanisms behind how yo-yo dieting contributes to heart disease are not fully understood, but it is believed that the repeated weight loss and gain can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, which can damage the arteries. Additionally, rapid weight loss can lead to the loss of muscle mass, which can weaken the heart and make it less able to pump blood effectively.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of maintaining a stable weight for individuals with coronary artery disease. Dr. Sripal Bangalore, the lead author of the study, emphasized the need for a sustainable weight loss approach rather than quick fixes. \"The key is to find a way to lose weight and keep it off, rather than going on and off diets,\" he said.\n\nThe study adds to the growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of a healthy weight for heart health. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, and maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk.\n\nIn related news, a separate study published in the journal Circulation found that individuals with obesity who undergo bariatric surgery, which involves removing a portion of the stomach to limit food intake, experience significant improvements in heart health.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

In both accounts, NASA announced that the ISS experienced a cooling system malfunction, prompting the crew to take preventative measures to preserve the station's temperature.\n\nAccording to the first report, a cooling system on the ISS malfunctioned, causing NASA to scale back non-essential operations on the station. The cooling system failure led to a reduction in power usage in certain areas of the ISS. The crew was able to maintain the station's temperature and ensure the safety of the six astronauts on board. NASA engineers are currently working to diagnose the issue and determine the best course of action for repairs.\n\nThe second report provided additional details about the cooling system malfunction. It was revealed that one of the ISS's two external radiators, which help regulate the temperature of the station, had a coolant leak. The leak caused the radiator to shut down, leading to the temperature issue. NASA is assessing the extent of the damage and considering potential repair options.\n\nDespite the cooling system malfunction, the ISS crew continues to conduct their scheduled experiments and research. The six astronauts, consisting of Americans Mike Hopkins and Rick Mastracchio, Russians Oleg Kotov, Mikhail Tyurin, and Sergei Ryazanskiy, and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, are reported to be in good health and spirits.\n\nThe ISS, which is a collaborative project between NASA and 15 other international partners, has been continuously inhabited since November 2000.

Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

This discovery challenges the previously held belief that humans did not inhabit Australia until around 40,000 years ago. The site, known as Warratyi, was discovered by a team led by Giles Hamm, a researcher at the University of Adelaide. The team found stone tools, animal bones, and charcoal at the site, which were radiocarbon dated to the desired age. The discovery of these artifacts provides evidence of early human habitation in Australia and sheds new light on the continent's prehistory.\n\nThe discovery was made during a routine survey of the area by Hamm and his team. They were initially searching for evidence of extinct megafauna, but instead found signs of human activity. The team's findings were published in the journal Nature.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi is significant because it pushes back the known timeline for human occupation of Australia by several thousand years. It also challenges the theory that humans only arrived in Australia after the extinction of megafauna, which is no longer considered to be the case.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi is not the only recent finding related to early human habitation in Australia. In 2020, another team of researchers discovered evidence of human occupation in Tasmania dating back around 45,000 years. This discovery further expands our understanding of the early history of human settlement in Australia.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi is also important because it provides insights into the lives of early humans in Australia. The site contains evidence of the use of stone tools, the consumption of animals, and the use of fire. These findings help us to better understand the adaptations that early humans made to live in the harsh Australian environment.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi is a major milestone in the study of Australian prehistory. It challenges long-held assumptions about the timeline for human occupation of the continent and provides new insights into the lives of early humans in Australia.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Tsarnaev, who was sentenced to death in May 2015 for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds, is currently on death row at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nIn their appeal, Tsarnaev's lawyers argue that the extensive media coverage of the case made it impossible for him to receive a fair trial. They claim that potential jurors were exposed to prejudicial information, making it impossible for them to be impartial. Tsarnaev's team also argues that the death penalty itself is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawyers' filing comes after a recent Supreme Court ruling that could potentially impact capital punishment cases. In the case of Bucklew v. Precythe, the Court ruled that a man with a rare medical condition cannot be executed by lethal injection because it would cause him unnecessary suffering. Tsarnaev's team is hoping that this ruling could be extended to all death penalty cases.\n\nDespite the appeal, Tsarnaev's execution is not imminent. The appeals process for federal death row inmates can take years, and it is unclear how long Tsarnaev's case will take to work its way through the courts.\n\nAdditionally, it was reported that Tsarnaev's trial and sentencing cost taxpayers over $12 million. The money was spent on security, transportation, and other expenses related to the trial and sentencing.\n\nFinally, it was noted that Tsarnaev is one of only 62 inmates currently on federal death row, and that most of the other inmates were convicted of crimes that did not receive the same level of media attention as the Boston Marathon bombing.

{"pred": "\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, and despite extensive search efforts, its whereabouts remain unknown. Bayesian statistical methods, which use prior knowledge and data to make probabilistic predictions, have been employed to help locate the missing plane. These methods were successfully used in the search for Air France Flight 447 in 2009 and the USS Indianapolis in 1945.\n\nIn the case of MH370, Bayesian analysis has been used to refine the search area based on available data, such as the last known communication from the plane and the suspected flight path. The statistical models take into account various factors, such as wind patterns, fuel consumption, and ocean currents, to estimate the most likely location of the wreckage.\n\nThe use of Bayesian statistics in the search for MH370 is not without challenges, however. The data used in the analysis is incomplete and uncertain, and there are many possible explanations for the disappearance of the plane. Additionally, the search area is vast, and the resources available for the search are limited.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bayesian analysis offers a promising approach to the search for MH370. By incorporating prior knowledge and data in a probabilistic framework, statisticians can make informed predictions about the location of the missing plane and help guide search efforts.\n\nIn a related development, it was reported that Bayesian statistics were also used in the search for the missing Malaysian submarine, SC21. The submarine disappeared in April 2014, and like MH370, its location remains unknown. The use of Bayesian statistics in this search is similar to the approach used for MH370, with analysts using available data and prior knowledge to make probabilistic predictions about the location of the submarine.\n\nOverall, the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing aircraft and submarines highlights the importance of statistical methods in complex and uncertain situations. While the search for MH370 and SC21 continues, the application of Bayesian analysis offers a valuable tool for making informed predictions and guiding search efforts.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes.
