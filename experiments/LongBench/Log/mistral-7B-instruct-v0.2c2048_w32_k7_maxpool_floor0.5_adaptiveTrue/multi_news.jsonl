The studies found that cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more difficult for our immune cells to kill it.\n\nIn the first study, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time being killed by macrophages, our immune cells that engulf and destroy bacteria. The smoke-exposed MRSA was also more resistant to reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst generated by macrophages to kill pathogens, and antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense. Additionally, the MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, increasing its chances of invasion.\n\nThe second study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls and repel toxic substances. MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. The study also found that smoke-exposed MRSA was more virulent in mice, causing a significant difference in mortality compared to non-exposed MRSA.\n\nBoth studies challenge the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker.

Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent with each other and cannot be explained by a person lying flat on the fabric.\n\nThe researchers found that the hand and forearm stains on the shroud do not match up with the angles and positions that would be expected if the stains were made by a crucified person. The spear wound stain also did not match up with the expected angle and flow of blood. Additionally, the researchers were unable to replicate the lower back stain, which is a significant feature of the shroud.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has long been a subject of debate and controversy, with some believing it to be a genuine relic and others believing it to be a medieval forgery. The radiocarbon dating of the cloth places it between 1260 and 1390 CE, which is later than the time of Jesus. Despite this, the shroud continues to draw large crowds of pilgrims and remains a source of fascination and intrigue.\n\nThe findings of the new investigation add to the evidence that the Shroud of Turin may not be an authentic relic.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The rebels, who are seeking to establish an independent state called Azawad, have gained significant territory, including the cities of Gao, Kidal, and Timbuktu.\n\nThe Tuareg rebellion is not an isolated event, as leaders across West Africa are worried about similar threats to their own countries. The Tuaregs, who are a nomadic people living in several countries in North and West Africa, have a long history of rebellion and have been fighting for independence since the 1960s.\n\nThe coup and the Tuareg rebellion have led to a humanitarian crisis, with over 200,000 people displaced since January. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Mali is a landlocked country that imports all its fuel, and the neighboring countries have imposed sanctions, shutting their borders and freezing Mali's account at the regional central bank. This has resulted in long lines at gas stations and uncertainty about the future of civil servant salaries.\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has given the military junta a deadline to restore civilian rule or face further sanctions.

The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but are placed in institutions due to poverty or lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs.\n\nInstitutionalized children suffer from measurable and sometimes irreparable harm, including lack of education and physical or mental health issues, malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking. The effects on infants are particularly chronic, with many failing to thrive or dying.\n\nThe solution to this problem is not to make institutions more comfortable, but to eliminate them altogether. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 through investment in inclusive education and health, support for vulnerable families, and fostering, adoption, or other family-based care alternatives for children who cannot be with their parents.\n\nInternational donors play a vital role in this effort, as their funding choices and principles greatly influence the support available to children and families. The economic benefits of supporting a child in a family rather than an institution are significant, as these children are far less likely to become dependent in adulthood.\n\nLumos has seen success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where there have been significant reductions in the number of children in institutions.

The book, which goes on sale Tuesday, details the couple's heart-wrenching decision and the aftermath, including their grief and the impact on Davis' political career.\n\nThe second story involves an ectopic pregnancy that occurred in 1994.

The Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team eventually found Jane's body over 150 meters lower down. Detective Constable Tim Bird, the leader of the rescue team, told the inquest that the change in route was an attempt to traverse the west face to avoid the summit, but it would have been better to have retreated the way they had come or gone to the North Ridge.

The tax has led to price increases, with a case of Gatorade at Costco increasing by over 60%. As a result, customers are reportedly buying their drinks outside the city to avoid the tax. The tax also does not apply to sugary drinks sold at Starbucks, which has rejected the tax.

Some argue that the tax is regressive and unfairly targets the working class. Despite these criticisms, Seattle leaders have defended the tax and expressed confidence in its benefits. However, the tax has faced legal challenges and may face a referendum vote in the future. The tax has also been criticized for its inconsistent application, as some sugary drinks are exempted. The tax has also been criticized for its potential impact on small businesses, which may lose customers to larger retailers outside the city.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

{"pred": "\n\nTwo recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer, during pregnancy. The first study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that pregnant women who frequently used acetaminophen were more likely to have children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar disorders. The researchers cautioned that this does not mean that taking acetaminophen once will cause ADHD, but advised pregnant women to avoid long-term use. The second study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, also found an association between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and ADHD-like behaviors in children. However, the authors emphasized that their study did not prove causation.\n\nBoth studies have received mixed reactions from experts. Some believe that the findings warrant further investigation, while others caution against jumping to conclusions. Dr. Beate Ritz, the lead author of the first study, advised pregnant women to try to avoid taking painkillers as much as possible until more is known about the risks. Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, suggested alternative methods for relieving pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.\n\nAcetaminophen is a popular choice for pregnant women due to its mild effects and availability over the counter. However, it is not without risks. The drug can damage the liver in large doses and has been linked to rare but serious side effects in children, such as Reye's syndrome. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked drug companies to limit the amount of acetaminophen in their products.\n\nThe studies have raised important questions about the safety of commonly used medications during pregnancy. The authors of the second study emphasized the need for more research on the effects of medications on fetal development. Dr. Chapa urged women to focus on non-pharmacological methods for relieving pain and to consult their healthcare providers before taking any medication during pregnancy.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The mission, which will come closer to the sun's surface than any previous spacecraft, aims to unlock mysteries about solar wind and the sun's outer atmosphere. Parker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, first proposed the existence of solar wind in 1958. His groundbreaking work was initially met with skepticism but later proved correct.

It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased, often due to cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms.

As the forecast coordinator for the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Louisiana, responsible for New Orleans, he knew he had to convey the urgency and seriousness of the situation to the public. Ricks came up with a bold and effective solution: a dire weather forecast warning of unprecedented destruction and human suffering. The forecast, which included statements like \"most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks, perhaps longer,\" and \"water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards,\" was issued the day before the storm made landfall. The forecast, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, was considered by many to be the most dire and effective weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service.\n\nAt the time, evacuations were underway and people were starting to arrive at the Superdome. Ricks knew he had one last chance to get the message out. He sat down at his desk and using computers, history, and his fellow forecasters, he wrote the extraordinary bulletin titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE.\" The document predicted devastating damage, including roof and wall failure for most homes, total defoliation of trees, and water shortages leading to incredible human suffering.\n\nRicks' forecast was right, and the images of devastation that followed made it clear. The lifelong resident of New Orleans, who grew up in the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward section of the city, was back at work alongside co-workers who had no homes and were wearing the clothes they wore that day. Ricks, who had experienced Hurricanes Betsy and Camille in the past, was devastated by the response, but he had done everything in his power to warn people of the monster storm coming their way.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

Despite having more advanced stages at diagnosis, younger patients had slightly better survival rates than older patients, with five-year survival rates of 68.2% versus 66.5%.\n\nThe study suggests that the medical community should be more vigilant in identifying colorectal cancer in younger individuals.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

{"pred": "\n\nIn two separate news articles, the possibility of advanced alien civilizations and their energy consumption needs have been explored. According to a paper posted on arXiv.org, astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's model of galactic expansion, which outlines the three stages of energy consumption for technologically advanced civilizations, has been revived with a new twist. The author of the paper, Dan Hooper, suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only the best way to increase a civilization's resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving them isolated. Hooper explains that due to the presence of dark energy, stars beyond our Local Group will become unreachable in approximately 100 billion years. To prevent this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harness the energy from these stars before they become inaccessible.\n\nThe idea of advanced alien civilizations harnessing energy from their stars is not new. Science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described such structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker.\" Physicist Freeman Dyson later proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960. Dyson suggested that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. He proposed that these civilizations might re-engineer their solar systems by creating a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture their star's energy.\n\nKardashev proposed three types of civilizations based on their energy consumption: Type I, which harnesses all the resources of a planet; Type II, which harnesses all the energy of a star; and Type III, which harnesses all the energy of a galaxy. Humans are currently estimated to be at about 0.7 on the Type I scale. Reaching Type II would require harnessing all the energy of a star, which humans might achieve in a few thousand years. Type III civilizations, which would harness all the energy of a galaxy, are thought to be millions of years older than humanity.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has become a popular topic in science fiction.

In the \"Star Trek:", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those with the airline's mobile app to alert passengers when boarding starts.\n\nSeparately, United has announced a joint business agreement with Avianca and Copa Airlines, which is expected to provide customers with more choices and benefits when traveling between the United States and Central and South America.

Cruz, who grew up in a troubled home with physical and emotional abuse, found solace and support from Hooper. She took him in, provided him with a stable home, and helped him academically and emotionally.

{"pred": "\n\nRecent studies suggest that Mars once had a significant amount of water, potentially enough to cover nearly half of its northern hemisphere in a mile-deep ocean. This discovery, made through analyzing the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the Martian atmosphere, challenges the previous belief that water was an erratic presence on Mars. The evidence includes atmospheric maps showing strong isotopic anomalies and high deuterium enrichment, indicating great water loss. These findings suggest that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The existence of this ancient ocean makes Mars a more promising place for alien life to have thrived. The researchers used data from three powerful infra-red telescopes to make these conclusions. Mars' water, like Earth's, contains both hydrogen and deuterium. As normal hydrogen escapes into space, the concentration of deuterium increases, providing evidence of past water loss. The scientists believe that Mars was a warmer and wetter planet in its youth, with long-standing lakes, streams, and possibly even seas. This new understanding of Mars' ancient history has significant implications for the search for extraterrestrial life. The European Space Agency plans to send an Exomars rover to Mars in 2018 to look for chemical signatures of life.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court found that Nestlé had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that the shape is distinctive in enough EU countries.

The case has been ongoing for over a decade, with Nestlé spending significant resources to trademark the shape, which Cadbury had fought against. The Norwegian Kvikk Lunsj bar, which has been around since 1937, was mentioned as a potential competitor. The court battle began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the Kit Kat shape in Europe. After several years of back-and-forth, the trademark was granted in 2012, but Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, objected and took the case to the European Court of Justice. The court's ruling on Wednesday also dismissed some of Mondelez's objections to a 2016 lower court ruling that had found the EU trademark office was wrong to reject Mondelez's complaint.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent studies, researchers have challenged the common perception of dinosaurs as roaring beasts, suggesting instead that some may have cooed or mumbled with closed mouths. A study published in the journal Evolution argues that closed-mouth vocalization, a behavior common in birds, likely evolved in some dinosaurs as well. This behavior, which is used for mating displays and territory defense, is rare in small-bodied birds but common in large-bodied ones. Another study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, analyzed the vocalizations of various archosaur species, including birds and crocodiles, and found evidence of closed-mouth vocalization in both groups. This suggests that the behavior may have been present in dinosaurs as well.\n\nMeanwhile, a collaboration between researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah, funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, is working to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the sounds it can produce. This research may shed light on how dinosaurs made sound.\n\nIn related news, a set of web captures curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive is now available to the general public. The collection includes captures of the ISKME.org website and sites hosted by IGC.org.\n\nFinally, Gary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the Jurassic Park films, revealed in a 2013 interview that many of the dinosaur sounds in the movies were created using sounds from various animals, including tortoises, alligators, and even human voices. For example, the T-Rex's roar was created using a combination of elephant, rhinoceros, and bear sounds, while the velociraptor's hiss was inspired by a snake. Rydstrom also used recordings of birds, including parrots and ostriches, to create some of the dinosaur vocalizations.\n\nOverall, these studies and discoveries offer new insights into the vocal capabilities of dinosaurs and their living descendants, challenging long-held assumptions and shedding light on the evolution of animal communication.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

{"pred": "\n\nA new report published in the medical journal Lancet reveals that obesity is a growing problem worldwide, with nearly 30% of the global population, or 2.1 billion people, now considered overweight or obese. The USA leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's obese population, but other countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands, also have high obesity rates. The causes of obesity are complex and include the availability of cheap, high-calorie junk food and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity is a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and kills about 3.4 million adults annually. The number of overweight and obese people has increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children over the past 33 years. The problem is not limited to rich countries; it is affecting people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with not one country succeeding in cutting its obesity rate. The biggest increases in obesity among women were seen in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while among men, it was in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The problem is most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women are overweight or obese. The report notes that obesity is not just a cosmetic issue, but a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Obesity is appearing at increasingly young ages, with rates rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. The rate of increase in adult obesity has slowed in rich countries, but the problem is still a major concern. More than half of the world's obese population lives in just 10 countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia.

In the elections, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party was expected to consolidate its lead, with estimates suggesting they could win a majority of the seats in the new parliament. The Brotherhood's success comes as the military rulers, who took power after Mubarak's ouster, face growing opposition from the revolutionary forces and the Egyptian people.\n\nIn the trial of Mubarak and 10 other defendants, the chief prosecutor accused the former president of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" and ensuring his son, Gamal, would succeed him. Mubarak, who is currently in custody, faces charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the revolution. His sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial for corruption charges.\n\nThe trial, which began in August 2011, has been marred by procedural delays and controversy. Human rights lawyers representing the victims have called for the removal of the presiding judge, a request that was ultimately denied.
