In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The dig, which is a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, aims to provide a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.

Outside the courthouse, Cosby's defense team, led by publicist Andrew Wyatt, made fiery accusations of racism and sexism in the trial, comparing it to the ongoing controversy surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

The Senate has passed a bill to fund the government through mid-December, without these conditions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hard line against the House's position, urging Republicans to pass the Senate's bill and avoid a shutdown. He believes that Republicans will ultimately cave and pass the Senate's bill, as the economic and political consequences of a shutdown would be significant.\n\nIf a shutdown does occur, it could have a major impact on the Washington, D.C. region, which is home to many federal agencies and employees. An estimated $200 million in economic activity could be lost each day of a shutdown, and up to 700,000 workers could be furloughed. The District of Columbia itself could be particularly hard hit, as it is not a state and does not have the same legal protections against a shutdown as other jurisdictions.\n\nThe standoff in Congress is not just about funding for federal agencies, but also about larger political and ideological issues. Republicans are using the funding bill as a way to push their agenda on healthcare and other issues, while Democrats are trying to keep the government running without interference. The stakes are high, and a shutdown could have far-reaching consequences for the economy, the political landscape, and the lives of millions of Americans.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The probe is named after Parker, who first proposed the existence of solar wind in 1958. The mission aims to answer long-standing questions about the sun's outer layers and improve our understanding of space weather. The spacecraft will face extreme temperatures and radiation, but advanced heat shields will protect it.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

This elusive planet is believed to be located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond Neptune, and is estimated to be about 10 times the mass of Earth. The researchers, including Mike Brown, who was previously known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in Pluto's demotion from planet status in 2006, have used mathematical models and observations of distant objects in the Kuiper Belt to make their case. The discovery of Planet Nine could help explain the unusual orbits of certain Kuiper Belt objects and provide new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.\n\nBrown, who has since embraced his nickname and even wrote a book about it, has no regrets about Pluto's demotion and believes that the discovery of Planet Nine will help people understand the dynamic nature of our solar system. He and his colleagues are continuing their research to gather more evidence and refine their models of Planet Nine's orbit and properties.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is not the only exciting development in the field of planetary science. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, which conducted a historic flyby of Pluto in 2015, is currently on an extended mission to explore the Kuiper Belt and the distant reaches of the solar system. The spacecraft is expected to make a close approach to a Kuiper Belt object named 2014 MU69 on January 1, 2019, providing valuable data on the composition and structure of these ancient bodies.\n\nIn other news, astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile have detected water vapor in the atmosphere of an exoplanet located in the habitable zone around a star similar to the Sun.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

Previously, it was believed that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly emerged around 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, marking a \"human revolution.\" However, new evidence from excavations in Kenya suggests that these behaviors may have emerged much earlier, around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe discoveries include the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, which were found in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya. These tools, which include spear points and flint knives, were made from obsidian and show evidence of advanced manufacturing techniques. The researchers also found pigments and red ochre, which were likely used for body painting or cave art.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers discovered evidence of climate change and environmental shifts, which may have driven the development of new tools and behaviors. The Middle Stone Age saw significant shifts in climate and vegetation, which may have forced early humans to adapt and innovate in order to survive.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional view of human history and suggest that the emergence of modern behaviors was a gradual process rather than a sudden revolution. The researchers argue that this new evidence supports the idea that early humans were capable of complex behaviors and innovations much earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe studies also highlight the importance of ongoing research and excavation in Africa, which continues to reveal new insights into human history and evolution.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

However, this statement has been met with skepticism and ridicule, as many see it as an attempt to mask Apple's hubris and arrogance.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack also means that users will have to purchase new accessories, such as Lightning port headphones or dongles, in order to use their existing headphones with the new iPhones. This has led to concerns over the cost and convenience of the new setup.\n\nDespite the backlash, Apple remains committed to its decision, with Schiller stating that \"the future is wireless.\" However, it remains to be seen how consumers will respond to this change and whether it will ultimately prove to be a successful move for Apple.\n\nIn summary, Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack from the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models has sparked a heated debate among tech enthusiasts and consumers. Critics have expressed their disappointment and frustration over the move, with many labeling it as a greedy and arrogant decision.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

Kieran, who is also deaf, has a hearing aid and has gradually been able to hear, but the surgery was primarily cosmetic to improve his appearance and boost his confidence. The procedure was led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who harvested cartilage from both sides of Kieran's ribcage to create the new ears. The surgery was a success, and Kieran was delighted with the result, exclaiming \"Wow!\" upon seeing his new ears in a mirror.\n\nKieran, who has struggled with bullying and feeling different, expressed his desire to look like his friends and be able to wear sunglasses and earphones. His mother, Louise, shared her excitement for the operation, stating that Kieran had longed for it and that she wanted him to be accepted like everyone else. The psychological benefits of the surgery were emphasized by Bulstrode, who noted that it brings a significant boost to a patient's confidence and can improve their performance in school.\n\nThe procedure, which is not intended to improve hearing, is performed on about 100 children in the UK each year. It is a major operation, with Kieran requiring a follow-up surgery in six months to make his ears stand out more from his scalp.

According to the first passage, scientists have discovered strong isotopic anomalies in Martian water, indicating that it had undergone significant water loss. The water loss is estimated to have occurred around 4.5 billion years ago, and the maps reveal that the water had a deuterium enrichment factor of at least 8 times that of Earth's ocean. This suggests that early Mars had a global water layer that was at least 130 meters deep.\n\nThe second passage provides further evidence of ancient water on Mars. Nasa scientists have discovered that a massive ancient ocean covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making it a more promising place for life to have existed. The ocean is estimated to have been around a mile deep and covered a significant fraction of the planet's surface. This discovery challenges the previous belief that Mars was a dry and arid planet.\n\nThe third passage also supports the idea that Mars once had a significant amount of water. Astronomers have used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to estimate that an ocean at least a mile deep covered Mars around 4 billion years ago.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

According to CNN, at least two lucky winners have matched all the winning numbers: 8, 20, 14, 13, and 7, with a Megaball of 7.\n\nThe Virginia Lottery Director, Paula Otto, reported that sales have been brisk, with a last-minute buying frenzy expected before the drawing. The jackpot could potentially reach the record-breaking $656 million jackpot won in March 2012. If there is no winner on Tuesday, the jackpot will roll over to the next drawing, with an estimated $900 million jackpot.\n\nThe winners, if there are any, are advised to sign the back of their winning ticket, take a selfie with it, and keep it in a safe place. They should also contact a financial advisor and an attorney before making any public announcements or claims. Anonymity is also an option, but it depends on the state laws.\n\nThe odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 258,890,850.

While you're at it, you might want to take a selfie with the ticket, then drop it in a safe deposit box. Then, seek out financial experts, but not too many—you want to keep the news quiet as long as possible. \"Start with one experienced attorney and look for a seasoned certified financial planner,\" Almasy writes.

The court found that Nestlé had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that the shape is distinctive enough in every EU country. The case began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for the trademark, which was opposed by Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury and Milka. Mondelez argued that the shape is not distinctive enough and that it infringes on their Leo bar, which is also a four-finger chocolate bar. The court's decision means that the trademark for the KitKat shape will be annulled, and competitors will be free to produce similar products. The case has been ongoing for over a decade and has cost both companies significant resources. The KitKat bar was first introduced in the UK in 1935, while the Leo bar was introduced in 1967. The two bars have similar shapes but differ in taste and branding. The Norwegian Kvikk Lunsj bar, which is also four-fingered, has been mentioned in the case as a potential competitor. The ruling has implications for trademark law in the EU and could affect other companies with distinctive shapes. The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between Nestlé and Mondelez over the trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury's Dairy Milk bars in the UK.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent studies, researchers have challenged the common perception of how dinosaurs sounded based on popular culture. According to new research, T. rex and other dinosaurs likely did not roar like they are portrayed in movies. Instead, they may have made quieter, closed-mouth vocalizations similar to those of modern birds.\n\nThe evidence comes from a study published in the journal Evolution, which analyzed the vocal abilities of birds and their extinct relatives, the dinosaurs. The researchers found that many birds, including large ones, use closed-mouth vocalizations for mating displays and other social behaviors. Since dinosaurs are the ancestors of birds, it is likely that some dinosaurs also used closed-mouth vocalizations.\n\nAnother study, published in the journal Evolutionary Biology, suggests that dino sounds may have been more varied than previously thought. The researchers analyzed the skulls of several dinosaur species and found that they had complex nasal cavities, which could have allowed for more nuanced vocalizations.\n\nAdditionally, a study published in the journal PLOS ONE found that some dinosaurs may have had feathers and used them for display during mating rituals. The researchers discovered fossilized feathers in the tail of a theropod dinosaur, suggesting that this behavior was more common than previously believed.\n\nDespite these findings, it is important to note that we cannot know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, as there is no direct evidence. However, these studies offer new insights into the vocal abilities of their descendants, the birds, and suggest that dinosaurs may have had more complex communication systems than previously thought.\n\nIn other news, the Internet Archive has made available a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham, which include web captures of websites related to education and research. The collections cover topics such as open access publishing, digital humanities, and data visualization.\n\nFinally, a study published in the journal Evolution found that closed-mouth vocalizations are not limited to birds, but are also used by some reptiles, including crocodiles.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

He also accused Mubarak of orchestrating the rigging of the 2010 parliamentary elections to ensure the succession of his son Gamal.\n\nThe trial, which began in August 2011, has been marred by delays and procedural issues.
