Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The house, which is believed to be one of the best preserved from the period ever found in the UK, will welcome visitors during an open day as part of the national festival of archaeology. The rectangular building, which is as neat as a modern house, has produced various finds including flint tools, pottery, and animal bones. Analysis of the seeds and grains found at the site will reveal what the people were growing and eating.

The child, wearing an amber necklace, was found in a foetal position. Scientific analysis will be conducted to determine the gender, diet, and date of burial of the child. The Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.

However, the permit system is based on the honor system, and there is no way to enforce this limit. The desert environments in the first 700 miles of the trail are particularly susceptible to damage from large numbers of hikers.\n\nThe increase in hikers has also put a strain on local resources, with helicopter rescues and searches becoming more frequent.

The dinosaur is significant because it had iridescent feathers, which glinted with rainbow colors, making it the first known dinosaur with such feathers. The discovery was made from a well-preserved fossil that included both bones and feathers.\n\nCaihong juji was a small, bird-like dinosaur, around the size of a crow, with a crested head and a body covered in feathers. Its feathers were not only iridescent but also asymmetrical, which is a key adaptation for flight. This makes Caihong juji the oldest known dinosaur with this adaptation.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji sheds new light on the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs. It suggests that feathers may have evolved for display purposes before they were used for flight. The researchers also noted that the dinosaur's crest may have been used for social signaling or mating displays.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji also challenges the traditional view that dinosaurs were drab and dull creatures. The iridescent feathers would have made the dinosaur stand out in its environment and could have played a role in its survival.\n\nThe researchers used advanced imaging techniques to study the fossil and determine the structure and composition of the feathers. They also used computer simulations to model how the iridescence would have appeared in life.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji is a significant find in the field of paleontology and adds to our understanding of the diversity and complexity of dinosaur species.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The House of Representatives passed a bill to delay the Affordable Care Act and fund the government until Dec. 15, but the Senate rejected it, and President Obama has threatened to veto it. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has urged Republicans to pass a clean funding bill to avoid a shutdown.\n\nThe economic impact of a government shutdown would be significant, particularly in the Washington D.C. region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers. An estimated 700,000 federal employees could be furloughed, resulting in a loss of $200 million in wages daily. The region's economy could also suffer from the loss of tourism revenue, as national parks and museums would close.\n\nThe standoff in Congress is not just about funding the government, but also about the Affordable Care Act. Republicans are using the funding bill as an opportunity to delay or defund the healthcare law, which Democrats refuse to do. The House bill would delay the individual mandate for one year and delay the employer mandate for businesses with fewer than 50 employees until 2015.\n\nThe Senate has passed a bill to fund the government until Nov. 15, but it does not include any provisions related to the Affordable Care Act. The White House has indicated that it would sign this bill if it reaches the House. However, House Speaker John Boehner has not yet indicated whether he will bring the Senate bill to a vote.\n\nThe political implications of a government shutdown are also significant. A shutdown would be the first since 1995 and would come just weeks before the midterm elections. Democrats are using the issue to criticize Republicans for being obstructionist and putting ideology over the needs of the country. Republicans, on the other hand, are arguing that they are standing up for the American people and fighting against an unpopular healthcare law.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and it is unclear when or if a resolution will be reached. Both parties are digging in their heels, and a government shutdown appears increasingly likely. The impact on the economy and the political landscape could be significant, and the situation is being closely watched by Americans across the country.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission, set to launch in 2018, will come closer to the sun's surface than any previous spacecraft, providing valuable data on solar wind and solar particles. The probe is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its effects on Earth and the solar system.\n\nParker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, first proposed the existence of solar wind in 1958. His theory was initially met with skepticism but was later proven correct. He is also known for his work on the heating of the corona and the solar cycle.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will travel at speeds up to 430,000 miles per hour and will get within 3.83 million miles of the sun's surface. It will face extreme temperatures and radiation, but its heat shield is designed to protect the spacecraft and its instruments.\n\nThe mission is expected to provide crucial data on solar wind, solar particles, and the sun's magnetic fields. This information will help scientists better understand space weather and its impact on Earth, as well as improve predictions of solar storms and their effects on technology and communication systems.\n\nThe renaming ceremony took place at the University of Chicago, where Parker has taught for over 60 years. The event was attended by NASA officials, university representatives, and Parker himself. The probe is a testament to Parker's groundbreaking work and his continued contributions to the field of solar physics.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is part of NASA's Living with a Star program, which aims to expand our understanding of the sun and its impact on life and society. The mission is also a collaborative effort between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Lockheed Martin Corporation.\n\nThe launch of the Parker Solar Probe is scheduled for summer 2018 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

In Kenya, Mohawk, a 13-year-old male lion, was shot dead by wildlife rangers after it attacked a man. The incident sparked controversy and outrage, with some questioning whether the lion could have been tranquilized instead of killed. The incident came amid growing concerns over the conservation of African lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.\n\nIn South Africa, Sylvester, a male lion, also escaped from his park and was being hunted by wildlife officials. However, unlike Mohawk, Sylvester had a large following on social media, with many people advocating for his capture and relocation rather than his death. The incident highlighted the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving wildlife.\n\nBoth cases underscored the challenges of managing wildlife populations in the face of habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and growing urbanization. Last year, the killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe by an American hunter sparked international outrage and renewed calls for greater protection for African lions.\n\nThe incidents also raised questions about the role of tourism in wildlife conservation. While tourism can provide significant revenue for wildlife reserves and help raise awareness about conservation issues, it can also lead to increased human-wildlife interaction and conflict.\n\nThe incidents also highlighted the importance of community involvement in wildlife conservation. In many cases, human-wildlife conflict arises from livestock raids or other forms of encroachment on wildlife habitats. By working with local communities to address these issues and find solutions that benefit both people and wildlife, conservationists can help reduce conflict and promote coexistence.\n\nOverall, the incidents serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges of conserving African lions and other large predators in the face of habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and growing urbanization.

This planet is estimated to be 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun every 10,000 to 20,000 years. The existence of this planet was first suggested by the unusual orbits of several other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech who was involved in the demotion of Pluto from planet status in 2006, is one of the leading researchers on this new discovery. He and his team have not yet directly observed Planet Nine, but they believe its presence can be inferred from the gravitational effects it has on other celestial bodies. The discovery of Planet Nine could help scientists better understand the formation and evolution of our solar system.\n\nBrown, who has been dubbed the \"Pluto killer,\" has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion. He believes that the definition of a planet should be based on whether it orbits the sun and has cleared its orbit of other debris. Pluto, despite being the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, does not meet this criteria. Brown also argues that the controversy surrounding Pluto's status has overshadowed the importance of other discoveries in the field of planetary science.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding the discovery of Planet Nine, it is important to note that it is still a theoretical construct and has not yet been directly observed. Further research and observations are needed to confirm its existence and to learn more about its properties. The discovery of Planet Nine could have significant implications for our understanding of the solar system and the universe as a whole.\n\nIn other news, the New Horizons spacecraft, which was launched in 2006 to study Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, has recently completed its flyby of the dwarf planet Ceres.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

{"pred": "\n\nIn the realm of space exploration and the search for intelligent alien life, several intriguing theories and discoveries have emerged recently. One such theory, proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that advanced civilizations can be categorized into three types based on their energy consumption. These types, or \"phases,\" include Type I, II, and III civilizations. Type I civilizations harness all of their planet's resources, Type II civilizations harvest energy from their star, and Type III civilizations harvest energy from other stars.\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, has added a new twist to Kardashev's model. Hooper argues that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only a means to increase a civilization's available resources, but also a necessity due to the expanding universe. According to Hooper, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and stars beyond our reach will become inaccessible within approximately 100 billion years. To prevent isolation, advanced civilizations may need to harvest energy from distant stars before they become inaccessible.\n\nAnother intriguing concept related to advanced alien civilizations is the idea of Dyson spheres. First proposed by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker,\" and later popularized by physicist Freeman Dyson, Dyson spheres are massive structures that surround a star and capture its energy. This concept has been a staple of science fiction, and some scientists believe that advanced civilizations may indeed construct such structures to harness the energy of their star.\n\nIn summary, the search for intelligent alien life continues to yield fascinating theories and discoveries. Kardashev's three-phase model of civilizations based on energy consumption, and Hooper's addition of the necessity to harvest energy from distant stars to prevent isolation, provide intriguing insights into the potential energy requirements and challenges faced by advanced civilizations. The concept of Dyson spheres, which has long captivated the imagination of scientists and science fiction writers alike, adds to the intrigue and highlights the vast potential for discovery in the realm of space exploration.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

These tools indicate that their makers were more mobile and had access to a wider range of resources. The researchers also found evidence of long-distance trade, as obsidian tools were found at sites far from their sources.\n\nThe studies also challenge the idea that modern human behaviors emerged only after the evolution of Homo sapiens. Instead, they suggest that these behaviors were present in earlier hominin populations, possibly even Homo erectus.\n\nThe researchers argue that these findings support the idea that climate change and environmental pressures drove the evolution of more complex behaviors in early humans. They also suggest that social networks and information sharing played a crucial role in the development of these behaviors.\n\nThe studies have important implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behaviors. They challenge the Eurocentric view that these behaviors originated in Europe and were only adopted by Africans as they migrated out of the continent. Instead, they highlight the complexity and sophistication of African cultures and the importance of studying them in their own right.\n\nOverall, the studies provide new insights into the evolution of human behavior and challenge long-held assumptions about when and where modern human behaviors emerged.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

They point out that Apple has a history of removing features that were once standard in its products, such as the CD drive in the iMac or the SD card slot in the iPhone 7.\n\nThe lack of a headphone jack is just one of the many changes in the new iPhones. Other features include improved cameras, water resistance, and a new A10 Fusion chip. However, these innovations have been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the headphone jack.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack from the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has sparked a heated debate among tech enthusiasts and consumers. While some see it as a bold step forward, others view it as a display of arrogance or even stupidity. Regardless of one's opinion, it is clear that Apple's move will require users to adapt to new ways of listening to music or using headphones, and it may come with additional costs.", "answers": ["Apple presented its new smartphone Wednesday, and nestled in with the iPhone 7's much-ballyhooed features was the disclosure that the company is getting rid of the phone's headphone jack—news that wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim, or much acclaim at all. Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

Kieran, who is also deaf and wears a hearing aid, has been longing for this surgery to improve his appearance and boost his confidence. The procedure, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from both sides of Kieran's ribcage and shaping it into ears. The surgery was primarily cosmetic, but it brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran, who had been bullied and felt self-conscious about his appearance.\n\nBefore the surgery, Kieran expressed his desire to look like his friends and be able to wear sunglasses and earphones. His mother, Louise, shared her hope that the operation would help Kieran feel more accepted and reduce the number of questions he faced from strangers. Following the procedure, Kieran was delighted with the result, exclaiming \"Wow!\" when he saw his new ears in the mirror. He will need a follow-up operation in six months to make the ears stand out more from his scalp.\n\nThe surgery was not without risks, as it involved a major operation on Kieran's ribcage.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The jackpot, which is estimated to be worth $586 million before the drawing, could potentially reach $636 million if all tickets sold are included in the final tally.\n\nThe winning numbers for the drawing were 8, 20, 14, 13, and 7, with a Megaball of 7. If the winners choose to take the lump sum payment, they will receive approximately $316.4 million each. However, if they opt for the annuity option, they will receive $29.2 million annually for the next 29 years.\n\nIf the winners do not come forward to claim their prize, the jackpot will roll over to the next drawing, which is estimated to be worth $970 million. The previous record for the largest U.S. lottery jackpot was $656 million, which was won in March 2012.\n\nThe excitement surrounding the drawing has caused a surge in ticket sales, with many people dreaming of the things they would do if they won the jackpot. Some common fantasies include telling their boss off, buying a new house, and traveling the world. However, lottery experts advise winners to take certain precautions before coming forward to claim their prize. These include signing the back of the winning ticket, taking a selfie with the ticket, and contacting financial advisors to help manage their newfound wealth.\n\nThe odds of winning the jackpot are extremely low, with one in 302.5 million being the chance of matching all six numbers. Despite the long odds, many people continue to play the lottery, hoping to strike it rich.

The court found that Nestlé had not provided sufficient evidence that the shape was distinctive enough in all EU countries. The case has been ongoing for over a decade and has cost both companies significant resources. The ruling could potentially open the door for other companies to produce similar four-finger chocolate bars without infringing on Nestlé's trademark. The dispute has also been mirrored in the UK, where Nestlé objected to Mondelez's trademark for the purple color used on Cadbury's Dairy Milk bars. The case has implications for trademark law in the EU and has been closely watched by trademark lawyers.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent studies, researchers have challenged the common perception of dinosaurs roaring as portrayed in popular culture. Instead, they suggest that dinosaurs may have vocalized with closed mouths, similar to modern birds. A study published in the journal Evolution found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are common in birds, may have also been used by some dinosaurs based on body size and behavioral patterns. Another study, published in the journal Evolutionary Biology, analyzed the vocalizations of modern birds and found that large-bodied birds are more likely to use closed-mouth vocalizations for mating displays. This suggests that some dinosaurs, which were also large-bodied animals, may have used similar vocalizations. However, direct evidence of dinosaur vocalizations is still lacking, and researchers are continuing to explore this area of study through a combination of fossil evidence, experimental physiology, and sound modeling. Meanwhile, a collaboration between researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California, Berkeley, is using a grant from the Moore Foundation to study the origin and evolution of bird vocalizations and the potential implications for understanding dinosaur vocalizations.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The researchers involved in the study, Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, believe this technology could eventually provide insight into the movies that play out in our minds, including dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe experiment involved subjects, who were researchers themselves, spending hours inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos. The MRI recorded the amount of blood flowing to the visual cortex as the subjects watched the videos. The researchers then used this data to develop an algorithm that matched neural patterns with dynamic visual information, such as shapes and movements, against 18 million seconds of YouTube clips. The result was a blurry, dream-like interpretation of the actual videos.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that this is only a small step towards mind reading, but it opens up the possibility of eventually being able to see what's going on in the mind without visual stimulation.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

{"pred": "\n\nEgyptians continued voting in the third round of parliamentary elections on Tuesday, while former President Hosni Mubarak's trial resumed with the chief prosecutor accusing him of imposing a corrupt regime and ensuring his son Gamal would succeed him. In the elections, Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and Salafist Al-Nour Party, are expected to gain significant power. The final results of the elections, which began in November, are uncertain due to ongoing protests and political instability.\n\nIn the trial, Mustafa Suleiman, the chief prosecutor, accused Mubarak of corruption and abuse of power, describing his 30-year rule as a period of oppression and violence. Mubarak, who is currently in detention, could face the death penalty if convicted. His sons Alaa and Gamal, as well as six other senior officials, are also on trial.\n\nThe elections, which are the first free and fair elections in Egypt's history, have been marred by violence and irregularities. Protests have erupted in various parts of the country, with some calling for the cancellation of the elections and others demanding the release of political prisoners. The military, which took power after Mubarak's ouster in February 2011, has promised to hand over power to a civilian government by the end of June.\n\nThe economic situation in Egypt is also a cause for concern, with growth slowing down and foreign investment dwindling. The country's tourism industry, which accounts for a significant portion of its economy, has been hit hard by the political instability and the ongoing protests.\n\nThe political landscape in Egypt is uncertain, with various political groups vying for power and influence. The Muslim Brotherhood, which has been the most organized and influential political force in the country, is expected to play a significant role in the new parliament. However, it remains to be seen how the different political groups will work together to form a stable and effective government.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak and the ongoing political instability in Egypt are likely to dominate the headlines in the coming days and weeks.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.
