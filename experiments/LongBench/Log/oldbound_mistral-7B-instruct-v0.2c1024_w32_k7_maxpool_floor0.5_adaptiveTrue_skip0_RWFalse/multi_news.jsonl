The rifle's simplicity and reliability made it one of the most widely used weapons in the world, with more than 100 million units sold. However, it has also been used by child soldiers and terrorists, causing much controversy and concern.\n\nIt is unclear how much of the letter was written by Kalashnikov himself.

The comparison to 1984 arises from the combination of data collection and transmission to third parties, as well as the potential for always-on listening.

The house, which is believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period ever found in the UK, is located near Stonehenge and is part of a much larger site that includes a huge enclosure. The rectangular building, which will welcome visitors next weekend, is as neatly levelled as modern houses and has already produced finds such as flint tools, pottery, and animal bones. Analysis of the seeds and grains found at the site will reveal what the people were growing and eating. The purpose of the massive enclosure, which is three times the size of Stonehenge, is believed to have been for displaying wealth and power.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child wearing an amber necklace was discovered. Scientific analysis of the skeleton will provide information on its gender, diet, and date of burial, which may shed light on the child's origins. The Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.

A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary.

This surge in hikers has led to concerns about overcrowding, environmental damage, and the impact on local communities.\n\nThe PCT, which stretches from Mexico to Canada, has a long history of attracting hikers seeking adventure and self-discovery. However, the influx of hikers in recent years has put pressure on the trail and its resources. The desert environments in the first 700 miles of the trail are particularly susceptible to damage from large numbers of hikers.\n\nThe PCT Association has implemented a permit system to manage the number of hikers on the trail and mitigate the impact on the environment. The system allows for a maximum of 50 permits per day for northbound thru-hikers. However, the honor system relies on hikers to adhere to the limit, and some are bypassing the system to start their hike earlier.\n\nThe increase in hikers has also led to financial strain for local communities, which rely on hiker business to support their economies. The strain is particularly felt in small towns along the trail, where hiker traffic can be heavy.\n\nDespite the challenges, many hikers continue to be drawn to the PCT for its beauty and the opportunity for personal growth. Some hikers, like Rusty, who hiked the trail in 2003, miss the quieter days of the past when the trail was less crowded.\n\nThe PCT Association is working to address the challenges posed by the increase in hikers, including education and outreach efforts to promote responsible hiking practices and the development of new infrastructure to support hiker needs.

Its feathers were preserved in exceptional condition, allowing scientists to study their microscopic structures and determine that they contained pigments that could have produced rainbow colors. The discovery suggests that dinosaurs may have had more complex behaviors and social structures than previously thought. The dinosaur also had asymmetrical tail feathers, which are a key adaptation for flight in birds. The researchers believe that Caihong may have been a glider or a tree climber, rather than a flyer. The discovery of Caihong sheds new light on the evolution of feathers and their functions in dinosaurs.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The standoff centers around the Affordable Care Act, with Democrats insisting on keeping it funded and Republicans seeking to delay or defund it.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) have taken hard lines in the negotiations, with Boehner pushing for a delay in the implementation of the health care law and Reid refusing to compromise. The Senate has passed a bill to fund the government without any conditions, but the House has yet to vote on it.\n\nThe economic impact of a government shutdown would be significant, particularly in the Washington D.C. region, which is home to a large federal workforce. An estimated 700,000 federal employees could be furloughed, resulting in a loss of $200 million in wages daily. Additionally, the region's tourism industry could suffer, with the National Mall and other popular attractions potentially closing.\n\nThe political consequences of a shutdown are also uncertain. Democrats are blaming Republicans for the impasse, while Republicans argue that they are standing up for the American people by fighting against the Affordable Care Act.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

{"pred": "\n\nIn the realm of space exploration and the search for intelligent alien life, several intriguing theories and discoveries have emerged recently. One such theory, proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that advanced civilizations can be categorized into three types based on their energy consumption. These types, or \"phases,\" include Type I, II, and III civilizations. Type I civilizations harness all of their planet's resources, Type II civilizations harvest energy from their star, and Type III civilizations harvest energy from other stars.\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, has added a new twist to Kardashev's model. Hooper argues that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only a means to increase a civilization's available resources, but also a necessity due to the expanding universe. According to Hooper, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and stars beyond our reach will become inaccessible within the next few billion years. Therefore, advanced civilizations would need to harvest energy from these distant stars to prevent isolation and ensure their continued growth.\n\nAnother intriguing concept related to advanced alien civilizations is the idea of Dyson spheres. First proposed by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker,\" and later popularized by physicist Freeman Dyson, Dyson spheres are massive structures that surround a star and capture its energy. This concept has been a staple of science fiction for decades, and some scientists believe that advanced civilizations may indeed construct such structures to harness the energy of their star.\n\nIn summary, the search for intelligent alien life continues to yield fascinating theories and discoveries. Kardashev's three-phase model of civilizational growth and Hooper's addition of the necessity for energy harvesting from distant stars provide intriguing insights into the potential energy consumption and expansion of advanced civilizations. Meanwhile, the concept of Dyson spheres, first proposed in science fiction, continues to capture the imagination of scientists and the public alike.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "\n\nThree new studies published in the journal Science have challenged the long-held belief that modern human behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly emerged around 40,000 years ago, marking a \"human revolution.\" Instead, the research suggests that these advanced behaviors were present much earlier, around 300,000 years ago, in Africa.\n\nThe findings come from excavations in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, where researchers discovered Middle Stone Age tools that are distinctively different from earlier ones. These new tools include smaller, more intricately made stone flakes, which required greater planning and skill to produce. Additionally, some of the tools were made from obsidian, a volcanic glass that would have had to be transported from distant sources, indicating long-distance trade and communication networks.\n\nThe researchers also found evidence of climate change around the time these new tools were being used. They propose that the unpredictable climate may have forced early humans to adapt and innovate in order to survive.\n\nThe discovery of these advanced behaviors in Africa challenges the Eurocentric view that modernity arose only when humans left Africa and migrated to Europe. Some researchers have argued for decades that Africa was the cradle of modern human behavior, but their views were not widely accepted.\n\nThe studies also shed new light on the complex relationship between behavior and hominin species during this time period. While Homo sapiens were present in Africa, other hominin species such as Homo heidelbergensis and Homo erectus were also living there. It is still unclear which species were responsible for producing the new tools, but the findings suggest that there was significant cultural exchange and innovation happening among these early human populations.\n\nOverall, these studies provide important new insights into the origins of modern human behavior and challenge long-held assumptions about when and where these behaviors emerged. They also highlight the importance of continuing to explore and study the rich archaeological record of Africa to better understand our human history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

She was hospitalized with minor injuries. Her father tells the Herald that after the plane crashed into a mountain, it caught fire and she was unable to get her step-grandparents out. She spent about a day near the plane waiting for rescue before following a stream and then a trail out of the woods, her father says. Friends say both father and daughter are completely overwhelmed. \"She did joke that it was a good thing she'd watched all those Survivor shows that she didn't like, but her dad made her watch anyway,\" a family friend tells the Seattle Times.

Gibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz has been vocal about the situation, expressing frustration over the lack of transparency regarding the allegations against his company. The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law amended in 2008 to include plants, requires end users of endangered wood to verify its legality. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has accused Gibson of knowingly importing tainted wood, despite the company's claims of compliance with the law and its halt of Madagascar imports in 2009.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

In the second passage, researchers have found evidence of a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half of Mars' northern hemisphere. This ocean, which lasted for millions of years, held enough water to make Mars a more promising place for life.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Instead of the terrifying roars often depicted in movies, new evidence suggests that some dinosaurs may have vocalized with closed mouths, producing sounds similar to those of modern birds.\n\nThe first study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of various bird species and their ancestors, the crocodiles. The researchers found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are common in birds, may have also been used by some dinosaurs. This conclusion is based on the fact that birds and crocodiles are both part of the archosaur group, and large-bodied archosaurs are more likely to exhibit this behavior.\n\nAnother study, published in the journal Evolutionary Biology, focused on the fossilized skulls of several dinosaur species. The researchers found that some of these dinosaurs had structures in their skulls that could have been used for closed-mouth vocalizations. This discovery further supports the theory that some dinosaurs may have sounded more like birds than the roaring monsters portrayed in popular culture.\n\nAdditionally, a study published in the journal Evolutionary Anthropology suggested that the T. rex, one of the most iconic dinosaurs, may have had a more bird-like vocalization. The researchers analyzed the fossilized jawbone of a T. rex and found that it had a structure similar to the syrinx, a vocal organ found in birds. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the T. rex roared like a lion or a bear.\n\nThe exact sounds that dinosaurs made are still a mystery, as there is no direct fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

By piecing together the brain patterns of subjects as they watched YouTube videos, scientists were able to produce a continuous, albeit abstract, reconstruction of the actual videos. This is the first time scientists have been able to read a dynamic visual experience from brain activity, paving the way for potential advancements in fields such as dream and thought interpretation. The researchers involved in the study, Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, believe this technology could eventually provide insight into the movies that play out in our minds, including dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe experiment involved subjects, who were researchers themselves, spending hours inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos. The MRI recorded the amount of blood flowing to the visual cortex as the subjects watched the videos. The researchers then used this data to develop an algorithm that matched neural patterns with dynamic visual information, such as shapes and movements, against 18 million seconds of YouTube clips. The result was a blurry, dream-like interpretation of the actual videos.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that this is only a small step towards mind reading, but it opens up the possibility of eventually being able to see what's going on in the mind without visual stimulation. Gallant, the lead author of the study, stated, \"We are opening a window into the movies in our minds.\" The team plans to continue their research by looking at more visual modules in the brain and building more accurate models.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast, including the ability to broadcast imagery and potentially even access a person's dreams or memories.

The couple had been planning their annual vacation and were looking forward to it before their unexpected deaths.\n\nThe early theory of investigators is that Mr. Sherman may have killed his wife and then taken his own life, but the couple's grown children have dismissed this theory. The family released a statement expressing their shock and disbelief at the rumors circulating in the media, stating that their parents' deaths were inconsistent with the rumors.\n\nThe Shermans were well-known in Toronto's Jewish community and were active philanthropists. They had recently listed their mansion for sale for $15 million. The couple had a net worth of over $4 billion and were known for their business acumen and philanthropic efforts.\n\nFriends and colleagues have expressed their shock and sadness at the news of the couple's deaths. Apotex released a statement expressing its condolences to the family and stating that the company would continue to operate as usual.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and no suspects have been identified at this time. The Toronto police are urging anyone with information to come forward.

Police, who have described the deaths as \"suspicious,\" revealed Sunday that the cause of death for both Shermans was \"ligature neck compression,\" a form of strangulation, the CBC reports. Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later. The couple also sent out invitations last week to a dinner party at their winter home in Palm Beach."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2360}
{"pred": "\n\nEgyptians continued voting in the third round of parliamentary elections on Tuesday, while former President Hosni Mubarak's trial resumed with the chief prosecutor accusing him of imposing a corrupt regime and ensuring his son Gamal would succeed him. In the elections, Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and Salafist Al-Nour Party, are expected to gain significant power. The final results of the elections, which began in November, are uncertain due to ongoing protests and political instability.\n\nIn the trial, Mustafa Suleiman, the chief prosecutor, accused Mubarak of corruption and abuse of power, stating that he deserved the harshest penalty. Mubarak, who is currently in detention, could face the death penalty if found guilty. The trial, which began in August, has been delayed due to various legal challenges and procedural issues.\n\nThe elections, which are the first free and fair elections in Egypt's history, have seen a high turnout, with over 52% of eligible voters casting their ballots in the first two rounds. The Muslim Brotherhood and Salafist parties have emerged as the frontrunners, with the Muslim Brotherhood expected to win a majority of seats in the parliament.\n\nThe political instability in Egypt continues, with protests taking place on a regular basis. The military rulers, who have been in power since Mubarak's ouster in February 2011, have yet to announce a timeline for handing over power to a civilian government. The ruling military council has also faced criticism for its handling of the transition process and its use of force against protesters.\n\nThe economic situation in Egypt is also a cause for concern, with growth slowing down and foreign investment dwindling. The country's foreign reserves have dropped by over $30 billion since the revolution, and the tourism industry, which is a major source of revenue, has been hit hard by the political instability.\n\nThe trial and elections take place against the backdrop of growing opposition to the military rulers and calls for greater political reform. Protests are expected to continue in the coming weeks, with the anniversary of the revolution on January 25 being a significant date. The political situation in Egypt remains uncertain, with the outcome of the elections and the trial likely to have a significant impact", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
