The Welsh Government's Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCW) monitors the universities' financial health and requires them to submit financial plans. HEFCW also has the power to intervene if a university is in financial difficulty. The universities' estates strategies are subject to scrutiny by HEFCW to ensure that they are prudent and sustainable. HEFCW also requires universities to demonstrate that their borrowing is necessary and affordable, and that they have a plan to repay the debt. The universities' financial reports show that they have significant debt, but this is largely due to their estate investments. The universities' financial challenges are not unique to Wales, and they are facing similar pressures in other parts of the UK. The universities' financial sustainability is a concern, but HEFCW does not see a crisis at present. The universities are managing their finances carefully, and they are taking steps to reduce their costs and increase their income. HEFCW is working with the universities to help them navigate the financial challenges and to ensure that they remain financially sustainable in the long term.", "answers": ["Bethan Owen took Cardiff University as an example and he believed that in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff would appear as though they have significant cash balances.
