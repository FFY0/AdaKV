# SnapKV :camera:
We introduce an innovative and out-of-box KV cache compression method, [SnapKV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14469).
## Requirements
Currently tested with `transformers==4.37.0`, need to check if it is compatible with higher version.
```
transformers>=4.36
flash-attn==2.4.0
```
## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:FasterDecoding/SnapKV.git
cd SnapKV
pip install -e .
```
## Quick Start
### Use SnapKV-optimized Models
For example:

```python
from adaptive_snapkv.monkeypatch.monkeypatch import replace_mistral

replace_mistral()  # Use monkey patches enable SnapKV
```

Check [the example notebook](./notebooks/example.ipynb).

### Customize Your SnapKV-optimized Models
SnapKV can be easily integrated with other models. 

You can follow the comment marked with `[SnapKV]` in [existing models](adaptive_snapkv/monkeypatch/monkeypatch.py) to construct your own models. (Currently we support [Llama family](adaptive_snapkv/monkeypatch/llama_hijack_4_37.py)/ [Mistral](adaptive_snapkv/monkeypatch//mistral_hijack_4_37.py)/ [Mixtral](adaptive_snapkv/monkeypatch//mixtral_hijack_4_37.py)) 

The detailed algorithm of SnapKV is in [`snapkv_utils.py`](adaptive_snapkv/monkeypatch/snapkv_utils.py)

## TODO
- [ ] Add observation experiments for reduplication.
- [ ] Add LongBench for reduplication.
- [ ] Explore the prompt phase compression.
